Poem by Julia (juliadoglover11405):
Damsel In Distress
She wakes alone in her cage
A cage so cold and empty
Trapped in by someone once called a friend
She now begins to question her safety
Hearing small muffles of noise beginning a trend
One by one the chorus of cries begins
A grumble from her own stomach with no end
She cannot remember her last meal
The wall of cries begins to echo against the metal walls
Her stomach turns from the hunger
Her eyes well up as she begins to bawl
She yearns for an Deluxe Peophin Burger
Louder and louder with no end in sight
Her lungs scream in exhaust
Her cries yell out for just one bite
Just when all hope is lost
She spots a bright light
Young Neopians' running to save the day?
Her prince charming arrives, she can't help but purr
He smiles politely with an inventory of Gourmet
There in his bag, an Deluxe Peophin Burger!
Her prince coming forth with a noble rescue
Placing the burger at her feet, she begins to feast
Her day begins to brighten as she chews
The hunger in her belly cease
With every Kadoatie will full guts
Silence in the Kadoatery for another Twenty-eight minutes.

A History of Famous Yurbles

Yurbles were first discovered in Neopia in Year 6 and are found everywhere in Neopia, yet we don't have a lot of visibility. I mean, how many of you can name a Yurble besides the Janitor in Altador? That's why I'm here as your friendly Yurble guide to present a history of our species and the important contributions Yurbles have made to Neopia! I hope this article will help us gain the recognition our species deserves!

General Yurbles (pronounced yer-bul) are easy to recognize because of our beautiful manes and cute curly ears. We're strong and sturdy too. We are generally very outdoorsy and have impressive appetites. All the Yurbles I know love getting together for camping trips and cooking big meals over a campfire. We hate getting wet though - it takes forever to dry our thick fur. Yuck! So we make sure to stay inside when it rains.

Yurbles are quite friendly and outgoing so it's easy to get to know us. There are a lot of great Yurble friends waiting to be made in any region of Neopia you visit. Maybe you should even consider adopting one - we make great companions!

Now, on to some of our famous kin:

The Yurble Raider
The oldest legend among our kind is that of the Yurble Raider. Many years ago, he was a greatly feared pillager, stealing food, supplies, and money without ever getting caught. He was renowned for his proficiency as an archer, able to hit impossible targets with a single shot. He was stealthy, adventurous, and never backed down from a fight, vanquishing anyone who threatened his success.

During the War of Meridell, he attacked both Meridellian and Darigan citizens, not to mention their armies! Even Lord Kass didn't scare him. In fact, he actually came face-to-face with Lord Kass himself one night.

It was a typical night for the Yurble Raider, sneaking into a village unnoticed as the citizens of Meri Acres ran from an attack by Kass's forces. As he ran off with his expensive loot, he got caught between the advancing forces of both sides of the war. He turned to run so he wouldn't be caught in the midst of battle, and found Lord Kass staring him down! Kass demanded the Yurble Raider hand over the expensive weapons he had stolen, but the Raider was not one to be pushed around. Instead, he aimed a lightning-fast kick at Kass's head, knocking him back into a wall. When Kass tried to punch back, the Raider broke his hand! He not only fought Kass, but lived to tell the tale, escaping with his arms full of valuable weaponry.

YRB-X1 (Yurbot)
Although Yurbot isn't the nicest guy, he's still a pretty prominent and accomplished Yurble. He is a robot Yurble who Dr. Sloth trusted to run the space faerie token plant on his mothership. That's a really big responsibility, but I know he was a good choice because Yurbles are very reliable. Most of us thought he was destroyed when Dr. Sloth's ship went down, but there have been a few sightings of him around Neopia since then. If you do see him, be careful not to get on his bad side - he has quite the temper. Yikes!

Volsan
Volsan is a Sultan from the Lost Desert. He has been searching his whole life for a lost city somewhere in the desert that is said to be full of untold riches. Volsan is a great icon for Yurbles because of his leadership, adventurousness and his commitment to a goal without ever giving up. I hope he finds the treasure some day! Wouldn't that be amazing?

Altador Cup Players
Like everyone else in Neopia, us Yurbles LOVE the Altador Cup, and we are happy to be able to cheer for some incredible Yurble players. Here are just a few of the biggest names to play in the tournament over the years:

Hoke Lemtry played for the Krawk Island Yooyuball Team in year 6 as a right defender. He was a strong, hard-working player but unfortunately was easily duped by his opponents so he was dropped from the team. But hey, us Yurbles are trusting pets. We're still proud of him!

Yaniq Avaan played for Mystery Island's team in years 8 and 9. He was an incredible goal keeper but unfortunately faced a lot of injuries and eventually was unable to continue playing.

Autrey Fulse played for Haunted Woods in years 9 to 11. He was a key player on the team, great at stealing the ball and tackling. He even scored a few goals! I was sad to see him retire.

And finally, the longest standing Yurble player: Vere Polnicek. She has been a defender on the Moltaran team since year 12 and is still going strong! She's remarkably agile and has a great tackle. I really hope we get to see her in action at this year's Altador Cup! I don't know about you, but I'm counting the days. Maybe we'll even get to see some new Yurble players bring their teams to victory.

The Janitor / Foreman
Of course, I can't leave out the most famous Yurble, who seems to be everywhere. First he was a construction foreman and then a head chef in the Lost Desert, then he was a custodian caring for Altador's Hall of Heroes. He not only kept the Hall sparkling clean, but made sure to fix anything broken. You may not know this, but he's also a talented herb gardener. Truly a jack-of-all-trades, demonstrating our kind's aptitude for learning new sk.ills and working hard at whatever we do. It's a shame that he's most famous for his angry outbursts - it really gives us a bad name!

Well, I hope this helps bring a little bit more awareness of how prevalent Yurbles are throughout Neopia, and some of our wonderful traits. Even though a few of these famous Yurbles can be quite gruff, I promise most of us aren't! We're always looking to make new friends who will join us on an outdoor adventure. I hope you'll consider befriending a Yurble this year on Yurble Day!






ABC Poem by Kenzie
A Petri flew past me today
Because he wanted my attention.
Can't believe he wouldn't let me get away.
Did you know that Petri's love candy? And did you also know that
Eyries are green.
Flotsam are scaly, slimy, and can be mean.
Gelerts are green in summer and brown in late fall.
Hissi's are very short even though they stand tall.
Ice cream is delicious, and I love it so.
Jelly beans are very popular at Easter and then they seem to go.
Kougra's are so adorable and playful, it's true.
Lutari's can't be pounded or traded even if they are just blue.
Meerca's swing from trees with their tails.
Nimmo's can throw long distance even over the gaurd rails. .
Orgins are never down.
Peophins are naturally born to wear a crown.
Quiggles find answers.
Restaurants are great places to eat.
Skeiths find everything a delicious treat.
Tonu's always like to be on the clock.
Unis keep us fashionable as we walk around the block.
Vandagrye make beautiful music with hoots to the moon.
Wockys wish you'd pick better boones.
Xweetoks always make me smile.
Yurbles = Yikes
Zafaras are the least bit vile.




Ready! Set! Cheer! by Mai
It’s that time of year folks! Get ready to cheer on your favourite Altador Cup team! No matter which team you are rooting for, this guide features some fun ways to get into the team spirit.

Now do not wait until the first day of the Cup to get everything in order. Preparation takes time – make sure you get your gear ready well before the opening ceremony because it might be difficult to find some of these last minute. Now let’s get into the fun!

<b>Getting to know the community</b>
One of the best things about the Cup are the connections and friendships that are made along the way. If you need to complain to someone about why the right forward keeps missing his shots, your fellow fans are here for you! Has someone been injured or replaced? Has a team been DISQUALIFIED? Being part of a community of fans ensures that you are always up to date with the latest news. You can find fellow supporters in the Site Events board which has a forum for every team. Introduce yourself on your team’s forum and soon you will find yourself immersed in the celebration. And make sure you bring some snacks. You can’t watch the games without snacks!

<b>Team Gear</b>
This is one of my favourite parts of the Cup. Seeing everyone’s neopets covered in their favourite team’s gear is so exciting. There are so many wearables to choose from and they are available for all the teams that participate in the Cup. Customization is one aspect of the games that you definitely want to prepare for well in advance because some of those backgrounds are in high demand leading up to the Cup.

Before jumping in and decking out your pets in paraphernalia, you may want to consider what kind of costume your pet wants to wear. Does your pet want to be a cheerleader? You can find crazy wigs, pom poms and togas for any team to complete the outfit. Does your pet want to be a player? You can also find various backgrounds like the locker room backgrounds, road to the cup backgrounds or Altador Cup grounds backgrounds. Then, finish off the outfit with a sport shirt, yooyuball racket and a team hat. Maybe your pet wants to channel their inner Techo Fanatic. Get your pet geared up with a jersey, face makeup and a foam finger. But of course, there is much more gear to choose from. My favourite Cup item has to be the confetti celebration. What better way to celebrate the Altador Cup than with lots of confetti!

<b>Neohome</b>
Customization is not the only way to get your cheer on, why not spread the joy to your neohome? A definite must have are team posters. Hang it front and center in your living room so no one makes any mistakes about where your allegiance lies… but they’ll probably get an idea from your furniture anyway.

Which brings me to interior decoration. Besides the staples, beds, desks and sofas, jazz up the space with interesting items from your world. If you are a Brightvale fan, bring their iconic designs into your home like the Stained Glass Brightvale Lamp or the gorgeous Brightvale Star Rug. If you are a Darigan supporter, a Spiky Darigan Candle Holder would be an excellent choice for your gothic abode. There are lots of great choices for every team.

You can also find yourself some beautiful wallpaper to match the theme. If you are a Faerieland supporter, the Fanciful Faerieland or Sparkling Faerieland wallpapers are some beautiful options. Virtupets Circuit Wallpaper is a fun and futuristic choice for a Virtupets themed neohome. If you are a Kreludor fan… well, I am assuming you like bright orange.

<b>Layout/Siggy</b>
While it’s great that you are getting your neohome and pets organized and themed, you might also want to consider another way to cheer for you team which is bringing in more fans. How can you achieve this you might ask? Well one of the first things people see when they lookup someone is their user lookup. Use your lookup to your advantage and get the word out about your team. Bring out your creative side by customizing a layout that’s made just for you and screams TEAM MERIDELL… or whoever you are rooting for. If you are not into graphics or coding, have no fear! As the opening ceremony approaches, you will find lots of talented people promoting their premade templates made just for the Cup on the neoboards. With your customized pets and neohome, your user lookup will be an Altador Cup haven.

A kind remember; if you are using a template that has not been made by you, be sure to credit the creators. They put in a lot of time and effort into their work and share it out of the goodness of their heart!

On the note of neoboards, how will you claim bragging rights against the other teams without showing off a little on the boards? Personalized fonts (aka signatures) are a great way to set yourself apart from everyone else and cheer on your team at the same time. There are a couple things you will want to do to successfully promote your team. First, pick out an avatar that matches the colours or the overall theme of your team. If you are a Terror Mountain fan Let It Snow! is a good option for you. Official fansites like jellyneo are a great resource if you want to see all the avatars that are available and attainable.

Next, you will want to make your signature. There are lots of great Neopian Times articles about how to code these, so I won’t take too much time talking about it. If this is not your cup of tea, head over to the Avatars/Neosignatures board to find amazing individuals promoting their font sites. Once you have picked a font, make sure it’s designed with your team colours. To personalize it further, add in your rank during the Cup to show everyone else how behind they are!

<b>Finally, have fun!</b>
While this event is a wonderful way to find a community and get into the competitive spirit, the Altador Cup is just a game. Sure, it’s an honour to win the Cup and everyone wants their favourite team to be the champions but being a sore loser (or a sore winner) keeps everyone, including yourself, from having fun. Just because someone is a fan of another team does not make them an enemy. In fact, you’re more similar than you think because that’s another person cheering on their favourite team, just like you! Make your necessary preparations, play the games, and have a good time.

And that’s it! Hope this guide gave you some ideas about how to prepare yourself to support your favourite team. Here’s to another wonderful Altador Cup and hope to see you all at the Colosseum!
