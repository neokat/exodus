<br><br><h2>Welcome to Exodus<br>December Activities!</h2><br>
        <i>Twas the Month of Giving<br>
when all through the guild<br>
Not a potato was stirring<br>
not even one grilled;<br>
The stockings were hung<br>
by the chimney with care,<br>
        <b>Hey wait a minute,</b><br>
        it looks like they aren't yet all there!</i><br><br>

    For December, most of the Exodus activities last <b>all month long!</b> A few of them have early sign up deadlines, or a Part 1/Part 2 with a deadline in the middle of the month, and some others you might want to do sooner than others to <i>enjoy the effects</i> within the guild.<br><br>

    We've also <b>brought back the points system</b> this month! That means that the top 3 winners will have a chance to redeem prizes from the winners prize pot, and everyone else can redeem their points for prizes from the shop at the end of the event. Prize redemption will last from January 1st through the 5th! Prizes for the winner pot and the shop will be announced on their respective pages soon.<br><br>

</div></div><span class="space"></span>

<div class="content"><div id="points">
          <h2>Points Information</h2>
Over on the right, you'll see an updated list of points for all of our members. These are collected through the entire month of December – the competition will end on <b>December 31st</b>.
    <br><br>
    <i>Points are updated 1-2 times a week. Please be patient in between updates.</i> Multiple members are hosting activities, so by updating 1-2 times a week, that allows the time to collect an accurate count.
      <br><br>
<h3>There are a few different ways to earn points!</h3>
The best way you'll be able to rack up your points is by participating in activities. We have three categories of activities: <i>monthly, weekly, and board</i> and they all offer different amounts of points based on completion!
<br><br>
We also award points to members who have gone above and beyond. Did someone make you a lookup, a font, or perhaps helped you code a page? Did someone grant one of your big NC or NP wishes? Did someone help you get your dream pet? <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">Please let Kat know!</a> You will receive <b>10</b> points for being the one to reach out, and they will receive points for doing a good deed. The number of points will be determined depending on the deed.
<br><br>
      <h3>Donating:</h3><br>
    <a href="//www.neopets.com/browseshop.phtml?owner=exodus_guild">CLICK HERE FOR OUR DONATION SHOP</a>.<br>There will be an infographic in the shop that describes our current point-to-neopoint ratio and our donation cap per week. Donations are tallied every Saturday, and will reflect in your point count by the following Sunday.

    </div></div><span class="space"></span>


<div class="content"><div id="prizes">
     <h2>Prize Pot</h2>
There will be <b>three</b> winners on December 31st. Instead of delegating certain rewards for each place, we have created a <i>prize pot</i>. <p>
<b>First place</b> will be allowed to choose <i>two</i> prizes from the pot: one non-item, and one NP item. You will get first choice. You will also receive a bonus mystery gift from council.</p><p>

<b>Second place</b> will be allowed to choose <i>two</i> prizes from the remaining prize pot, after first place has chosen theirs: one non-item, and one NP item. You will also receive a bonus mystery gift from council.</p><p>

<b>Third place</b> will be allowed to choose <i>one</i> prize from the remaining prize pot, after first place and second place have both chosen theirs. You will also receive a bonus mystery gift from council.</p><p>

<h2>Holiday Shopping</h2>
    <i>This is a two-part activity.</i><br><br>
<b>Part One:</b> Oh no! All of our holiday shopping got stolen! Our stockings were hung by the chimney with care...and now they are missing! Hit the Neopian Shops and buy some stocking stuffers for Exodus.
<br><br>

(<a href="/objects.phtml?type=shop&obj_type=17">Gifts Galore</a> or the <a href="/objects.phtml?type=shop&obj_type=14">Chocolate Factory</a> might be good starting places!) Set up a trade with your five items and send Vanessa the link. Your items will be used to stuff stockings for part two.
<br><br>
    <b> Part Two: </b> Neomail Vanessa and tell her <b>your favorite item to receive in a stocking,</b> and then she will send you a stocking! <i>You must have participated in part one to participate in part two.</i> Any unused items will be used for our Boxing Day Sale activity.

    "I have to say hands down one of my FAVORITE memories from Exodus this year was the great pineapple on pizza/trash reeses debate  After spending so much time in October bringing the spirit of Exodus to everyone, it was hilarious to see the debate that went on right after the birthday activities were done!

<h2>Boxing Day Sales</h2><br>
  This month, check out the guild shop for some holiday deals! We’ll be hosting flash sales throughout the month. You never know what Potatoclaus might have in the sack!<br><br>
    Guild shop sales will occur randomly and be posted on the guild chat when they are taking place, so keep an eye out! There are two types of sales that could occur:<br><br>

    <b>Neopoint Drives</b> will be events where the shop is filled to the brim with items priced at various amounts. The goal is for everyone to buy out the shop. Prior to the sale, one specific item will be earmarked as The Golden Ticket. The person who buys The Golden Ticket will receive a NP item worth 50k or more! All funds raised will go towards the guild, and everyone who participates in this sale will receive points for their donations!<br><br>

    <b>Flash 1k NP Sales</b> are sales where a lot of items, some valuable, some not as much, will be set in the guild shop. EVERYTHING will be priced at 1k. A time will be announced prior to the sale, and when the items drop, it's up to you to find and buy the good ones! No points will be awarded for this activity; the prize is the item(s) you are able to pick up!

    Our stockings aren’t the only thing that were stolen! When the grinch came by Exodus, he even took the decorations with him!  Luckily, we had some extras put away... if we could just remember where we stored them. Help us find all the decorations!

    Decorations can be on <b>any</b> guild member's pages, but there will be <b>none</b> on petpages or in fonts. (You will have to go through some captchas... good luck!) Find all 10 wreaths for 150 points! (Or earn 15 points per wreath found.) <br><br>
