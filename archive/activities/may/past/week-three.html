<h2>Welcome to Exodus' May Activity Page!</h2>
<h3>April showers bring May... greyscale flowers?! What? Where's all the color?</h3>

<h4>Participate in activities this month to restore our colorful guild to its full glory!<br><br>

This month, we are taking a break from our typical points system in favor of activities with a collective guild goal. There will be two big monthly activities: <b>Spotlight Spree</b> and <b>Recolor the Guild</b>, and 5 smaller activities updated every week. We are also introducing two new board games: <b>Saturday Game Time</b> and <b>Truth or Dare</b>.<br><br>

As you complete activities this month, you'll notice the guild layout and activity page start to come back to life!</h4><br>
~~~~~~~<br><br><h2>About Last Week</h2>
<h3>SKETCHY SALESMAN WINNERS</h3>
 <img src="https://i.ibb.co/4dSwpKf/pjimage.jpg">
<br><br>
 <h4><b>Funniest:</b> Vanessa (hummush)<br></h4>
 <b>Item 3: Vegetable Twister Spoon</b> || <i>Struggling to get your serves of vegetables in? Eating vegetables with this spoon will magically twist their flavour and make them all taste like delicious, fried potatoes! Mmm.. carbs.
<br><br></i>
 <h4><b>Most convincing:</b> Kelly (hilary_duff_fan_16)<br></h4>
<b>Item 2: Slippery Laughter Ink</b> || <i>This inky substance is the ultimate necessity of arena warfare! Watch as your opponent slips and slides around the battlefield while you enjoy some restful healing time. Guaranteed to make your opponent dizzy and the crowd laugh!
<br> <br></i>
 <h4><b>NEED IT:</b> Ice (honorrolle)<br></h4>
 <b>Item 3: Spinny Spoon of Restitution</b> || <i>Nothing is worse than a bad trade deal or a sniper that sweeps up a incorrectly-priced item. But my friend, you are in luck, because today I have something that you absolutely need in your neo-life. The Spinny Spoon of Restitution convinces the slinky snipers to not only return the item they so rudely sniped to your detriment, but to pay interest, handling fees and other spoon-mandated expenses. Once the SSoR is done with the snipers, they will wish they never started sniping in the first place.</i>
<br><br><br><br>
 <h3>GUESS THE MEMBERS</h3>
Mystery member 1: Online - Avoiding Work, Bun Bun, Plushies = <b>KENZIE! (mrsinvicta)</b><br>
Mystery member 2: Baby pets, Faerie Harris, rainbow feather = <b>JULIA! (juliadoglover11405)</b><br>
Mystery member 3: Shenkuu Stamp avatar, 8 1/2 years, pepper = <b>RHI! (cymrhi)</b><br>
 <br><br><br>

 <h3>MOM DAY MATCHES</h3>
 I would pretend I was going to relax and then after like 30 minutes be so bored that I'd give up and run out 14 times to pick up takeout, do an errand, buy art supplies, see a friend, attend a lecture, etc. - <b>elhiwe</b>
<br><br>
Eat some  nachos and chocolate milk, play skribbl with some potatoes, get my eyebrows waxed, go for a swim and fall asleep cuddled in a blanket fresh out of the dryer. - <b>aikuanda</b>
<br><br>
A perfect Mom Day for me would include self care! Whether it be a massage, facial, getting fillers, or hair appointment along with a shopping day and binge watching my present fave show with the pups! - <b>lockheaarts</b>
<br><br>
 here is my ideal me day (same thing for non mums I would say xD ) : Sleeping in, continue reading some fanfic while still in bed, getting up to watch youtube on my laptop, getting someone else to cook for me, sitting in the garden when the weather is nice, play and cuddle with my cats, going into the bathtub, reading, and going to bed after a whole day of doing nothing productive - <b>atritas</b>
<br><br>
I think if we were post pandemic, my perfect mom day would be a nice weekend (or really even a week day) in which I could go out with my friends to brunch and then enjoy some drinks on a patio. Maybe after that a movie and snacks! And of course some sort of over the top horrible food for you for dinner to top it off! - <b>hilary_duff_fan_16</b>
<br><br>
I would travel to see something new with hubs, watch a new movie in a theater, take a hike, do some weight lifting, play the drums and hang out with some friends! - <b>honorrolle</b>
<br><br>
What I would do on a day for myself; I would probably try to make a list of ideas for myself but still end up on neopets or end up trying to organize / clean something. I don't really have days to myself, It's always something! xD - <b>apostrasia</b>
<br><br>
The perfect me day from a non-mom would be going to play basketball in the morning, then coming home, and spending lots of time relaxing in the tub! An evening walk to relax the mind, and then melt my brain watching something haha! And of course, lots of good food! - <b>merpiie</b>
<br><br>
 The perfect mother's Day for me would be sleeping in, having my husband get all the kids ready and going out for the day to a zoo or family activity - <b>hunni_bun_137</b>
<br><br>
On a day all for myself, I would start the day with a nice cup of coffee and spend as much time as I want on Neopets. Then I'd love to go for a walk to the shopping centre with no intentions to buy anything really, just for a nice browse. And it'd be perfect to end the day with a nice homecooked meal! - <b>hummush</b>

<h2>Recolor the Guild</h2>
As you have definitely noticed by now, the guild is lacking some serious color. Grey Day really got to us, and Baelia the Grey Faerie made the guild match her personality. She told us that we can fix it, though—<b>it's up to us!</b><br><br>

The way to fix it is by <b>participating in activities</b>. Every time someone participates in an activity, the Grey Faerie is encouraged and her spirits are lifted. This activity is a <b>team sport</b>—we all win together! The only prize, of course, is bring the vivid colors back to the guild! <br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/342.gif"><br><br><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
The Grey Faerie's goal is for us to collectively earn <b>500 Color Points</b> during the month of May.<br><br><i>Well how the heck do you earn color points?!!?</i><br><br><b>ONE.</b> Participate in weekly activities (5 new activities/week, 1 person's participation = 1 color point)<br><b>TWO.</b> Participate in Spotlight Showdown (each spotlight ENTERED = 1 color point)<br><b>THREE.</b> Participate in our board activities (1 person's participation = 1 color point)<br><b>FOUR.</b> Post on the guild board! (Every 100 posts = 1 color point. Starting post count: <b>98,700</b>)<br><b>FOUR AND A HALF.</b> If we reach 100,000 total messages this month, the Grey Faerie will award an extra 25 color points!<br>
 <br><h4>ARE YOU UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?!?!?!</h4><br>

It's not all or nothing, though. As color points are earned, the meter below will fill up with color! As the meter is filled, more and more color will be returned to the guild. You will get to see your progress happen in real time! (About twice a week, but maybe more)

<div class="content"><div id="spotlight">
<h2>Spotlight Spree</h2>
This month our big activity is <b>SPOTLIGHT SPREE!</b> We are on a mission to enter as many site spotlights around neopets as we can to reach our collective goal as a guild: 50 spotlights entered in total, and 20 spotlights won. At the end of the month, we will have our very own <b>Exodus Newspaper</b> to show off everyone's beautiful submissions for the month! (And hopefully, our members will have a lot more trophies and NP prizes from those spotlight wins too!)
<br><br><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
You will earn stars for entering AND getting selected for any of the <a href="/contests.phtml">creative spotlights</a> listed below! Any spotlight you entered during the month of May counts, even if you entered earlier this week before this activity launched. Only one unique submission counts for each guild submission (for instance, you do not get multiple stars from entering the same art piece into the Art Gallery contest over and over—although it will likely help your chances to get picked by TNT if you enter multiple times!) You can only earn 1 submission star for each unique entry that you have.
<br><br><b>Eligible creative contests:</b> Art Gallery, User Lookup Spotlight, Neopian Times, Storytelling Contest, Poetry Gallery, and Gallery Spotlight
<br><br>
You must submit your piece to the relevant spotlight AND host your submission on a petpage and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail it to Kat</a> to earn your star for submission. At the end of the month, we will have an Exodus Newspaper to show off all of our work, whether it was selected for a spotlight or not! (Competition can be tough and it can be hard to get selected by TNT—don't give up!)
<br><br><h3>EARNING STARS</h3>
<b>Submit to a Spotlight:</b> +1 stars || make sure to neomail Kat with the form below<br><b>Selected for a Spotlight:</b> +2 stars || YOU WON! congrats! please neomail Kat with the form below<br><b>Jack of All Trades:</b> +5 stars || submit to the Big 4: Poetry, Art, Storytelling, & NT, and win at least one of them! <br><b>Guild reaches Spotlight Goals:</b> +10 stars || 10 stars for EVERYONE who participated by submitting to a spotlight when the guild reaches our montly goal of 50 submissions and 20 publications!<br><br><a href="#stars">Click here to see stars standings + how close we are to our guild goal!</a>

You will receive prizes based on how many stars you reach. The prizes are LADDER STYLE, meaning you'll receive each prize when you reach that many stars! Prizes will be given out as soon as that points threshold has been reached. The prize ladder is as follows:
<br><br><b>1 star:</b> Random Beige Codestone (~2k-16k)<br><b>2 stars:</b> Random Red Codestone (~9k-45k)<br><b>3 stars:</b> Little Timmys Story or Tale of Woe: The Untold Story - by Reginald (Autographed Copy) (~50k)<br><b>5 stars:</b> Random Nerkmid (~75k)<br><b>8 stars:</b> Oil Paints Set or Painting on Easel (~100k)<br><b>13 stars:</b> Starry Paint Brush (~250k)<br><b>21 stars:</b> Shining Spotlight (~500k)
<br><br><b>BONUS PRIZE:</b> The person who receives the WORST NP prize from their spotlight (lowest JN price estimate at the very end of the month, excludes Neopian Times) will receive a MUCH BETTER NP prize (750k+) from the spotlight prize pool! If multiple people all receive the worst prize, they will all receive the same much better (750k+) item. (creative contest spotlight pool: jellyneo.net/?go=contestprizes)

<h2>Restocking Bingo</h2>
  <b>This activity will expire on Monday, May 24 at midnight NST. (Unless it is determined that people would like more time on their boards... TBD.)</b><br><br>

We've got a lot of restockers in our midst these days, and a lot more people who are ready to learn! So this week we are putting our restocking abilities to the test with a BINGO CARD! Everyone gets the same exact bingo card, and your goal is to cross enough squares off to make one (1) BINGO (diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line)! Think you're up for the challenge?! (If you're not sure where to start, check out the resources section at the bottom of this page!)
  <br><br>
  To submit your cards, stick an image with your crossed out squares on a petpage and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail it to Kat.</a> (If it's easier, you can certainly just list the squares that you've marked off instead!)<br><br>

  <h3>PRIZES</h3>
  For participating and crossing at least one square off your card, you'll receive a random <b>Red Codestone</b> (~9k-45k). <br>For getting a BINGO (diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line), you'll receive a random <b>Nerkmid</b> (~70k).<br> If you get a BLACKOUT (all squares completed), you'll be rewarded with an <b>Extreme Potato Shower</b> (~2.5m)!<br><br>

<h2>Fanatic Creative Corner</h2>
<b>This activity will expire on Monday, May 24 at midnight NST.</b><br><br>

  This week's Creative Corner is hosted by <strike>Roxi</strike> everyone's favorite Techo Fanatic!<br><br>

  Below you'll see an outline of the Techo Fanatic, preparing his screaming and hollering for the Altador Cup next month! Your job is to color him in however you like, with a little twist. Since he has no yooyuball matches to practice his screaming with, it's up to you to draw in what he is cheering for! Get as creative as you want, and once you're finished, <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">send completed entries to Kat.</a>
<br><br>
  <img src="http://images.neopets.com/art/misc/fan_techo9.gif"><br><br><h3>PRIZES</h3>
  For entering your creation, you will receive <b>The Art of Being a Fan</b> (~15k), so you, too, can learn how to be <strike>like Roxi</strike> a screaming, passionate fanatic, and <b>Altador Cup Fanatic Bobblehead</b> (~75k), so you can always keep a little <strike>Roxi</strike> Techo Fanatic on your desk!<br><br>

<h2>Saturday Game Time</h2><br><b>SATURDAY! SATURDAY! SATURDAY!</b> Do you dream of getting absolutely crushed by El in Pictionary? Do you too wish you could take out your anger on your fellow guildren in a fun, who-done-it style game called Among Us? Do you want to see which potatoes are secretly cynical and unhinged in a totally not neopets-related game of Cards Against Humanity? Are you ready to have your entire spirit crushed by Tiara in a game of Avatar Simon?<br><br>

Join us <b>every Saturday</b> for a few hours of games!<br><br>
We'll try to start around <b>NOON NST</b> so that our spuddies far and wide can try to join in on the fun!<br><br>

<h2>Truth or Dare?</h2>
Truth or Dare is BACK BABY! We had so much fun with it that we are doing it again.<br><br>

At any point during the day, <b>Kat</b> or <b>Lynn</b> can hop onto the board and ask the age old question: <b>truth or dare?</b><br><br>

Everyone who is around that answers within a ~10 minute window will be able to answer with their choice of truth or dare. You will then be given a truth or dare to complete by either Kat or Lynn. If you complete the task, you win a prize. If you fail the task, well......... we aren't going to talk about what happens if you fail :) Because you won't :) Right? :)<br><br>

Your truth could be as simple as "what was your favorite neopet when you first started playing?" or as saucy as "tell me your most unpopular opinion about UCs." The dares can be funny, like "set your avatar to I'm Smelly and use it as your default font for 24 hours" or they can be totally involved, requiring you to make silly boards on the AC or post a propaganda message on the board every time someone asks as simple a question as "how are you?" to the group.<br><br>

Truths and dares and their resulting answers or success/failure status will be posted here for all to see!<br><br>

The prize for completing a TRUTH will be greyscale and dull, while the prize for completing a DARE will be a lot more colorful!<br><br><h3>PRIZES</h3><b>Successfully completing a truth:</b> Grey Faerie Card (~20k)<br><b>Successfully completing a dare:</b> Rainbow Negg Plushie (~45k)
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/blacktradingcardback.gif"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_plushie_negg_rainbow.gif"><br><br><b>NOTE:</b> you are eligible to complete more than one truth or dare, but you may only have one ACTIVE truth or dare at a time. That means you can't get another truth or dare while you are still completing the first one!<br><br><br>
