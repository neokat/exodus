HI SPUDS! It's a BINGO BANANZA up in Exodus, check out /~Rhedle#bingo if you haven't signed up yet :D I'm here with a few BINGO clarifications~

* If you've signed up but haven't gotten your bingo board yet, please check in with me again bc we all know neomail is built on spaghetti and duct tape XD

* If you are primarily mobile user, I'm happy to host your bingo board on my own petpage; no Exodian left behind!

* You MUST send me the link to your bingo board hosted on a pet page in order to receive ANY guild points for this activity; make sure /~Melodized#allboards has your name and correct petpage linked!

* The ONLY time you need to mail me about a BINGO is your first one, so that I can award your speed bonus points (: all other points will be updated by me looking through boards every few days!

AVATAR REMINDER: If you don't have I Heart Sloth/Hapiness yet, today is your one chance a year to get! Go here: /space/mindcontrollab.phtml and enter answers C D B C A. Then set new av #1 as you active av and go here: /hero/showhero.phtml?hero=ihearthappiness for new av #2.

Also a huge congratulations to Ariana, our first Member of the Moment! Sheâ€™s done so much for Exodus so please head over to /~exoduswebbie#motm to read more about her!

That's all I got, please let me know if you have any questions! I hope it is a fun and challenging activity!

MUCH LOVE,
KAT
