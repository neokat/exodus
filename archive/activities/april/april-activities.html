<b>Lynn's Roasted Red Potatoes</b><br>
Ingredients<br>
4 cups chopped/halved red potatoes <br>
1 1/2 pounds<br>
1/4 cup olive oil<br>
3 tablespoons parmesan cheese<br>
1 teaspoon garlic salt<br>
1 teaspoon dried basil<br>
1 teaspoon dried parsley<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br>
Instructions<br>
Heat oven to 400°. Spray a cooking sheet with cooking spray. Set aside.<br>
Add the chopped/halved red potatoes, olive oil, parmesan cheese, garlic salt, dried basil, dried parsley, salt, and pepper into a mixing bowl. Stir together until all the potatoes are coated.<br>
Spread the potatoes evenly onto the cookie sheet making sure that there are no potatoes that are overlapping. For the best roasted potatoes you want them spread out so all sides can crisp up.<br>
Cook for 30-35 minutes, stirring halfway through the cook time.<br>
 The cook time may vary depending on the size of your potato chunks. Mine cook for 30 minutes and they are roughly 1-inch sized pieces. If you like the potatoes really crispy then cook for even longer depending on preference.<br>
 When you stir the potatoes halfway through the cook time, use a spatula, and know that some potatoes may be stuck (slightly) to the cookie sheet, this is totally fine and they will come off with a spatula. It's just the parmesan cheese sticking. This is also why you need to stir them halfway through, so that all sides can crisp up, and so none are sticking to the pan for the whole cook time.<br>
Notes<br>
I like to use the small petite baby red potatoes. They are small in size so you really only have to cut each one in half. For larger ones maybe cut into fourths. You can use regular red potatoes but just know that not all the pieces will have skin (which the skin gets roasted and crispy so it's really the best part.<br><br><b>

Lau's Fried Mashed Potato Puffs</b><br><br>

INGREDIENTS<br>
650 g of potatoes (around 7 mid-sized yellow potatoes or 10 smaller red ones)<br>
2 egg yolks<br>
Flour<br>
Cooking oil<br>
Salt<br>
Pepper<br><br>
PROCEDURE<br>
1. Peel the potatoes and cut into slices. Put into a cooking pot with cold water and lots of salt. The water should be completely covering the potatoes. Cook over mid-high heat. When the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and leave cooking for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked.<br>
2. Take out the potatoes and drain them, leave them out a few minutes until they dry a bit.<br>
3. Put cooking oil into the pan (about two fingers tall) and heat up until it's reached 180 ºC. Do not put the potatoes in yet.<br>
4. Take the potatoes out and MASH THEM into purée, you can use your hands or a potato masher. Put the mashed potatoes in a bowl and add some salt and pepper. Add the two egg yolks into the bowl and knead until it's homogeneous. Use a spoon to take a portion and make this portion into a cute potato sphere (should be the size of a golf sphere). Cover with flour. Then repeat several times until you run out and are only left with potato spheres.<br>
5. Pre-heat your oven to 100 ºC (or 200 ºF) only if you need to keep the potatoes warm until they're served.<br>
6. Use the pan to fry about 8 potatoes at a time (depending on your pan size). The potatoes should be in for about 3 minutes until they're golden and pretty. If a potato sphere starts opening up, remove from oil immediately. Put the fried puffs on absorbent paper to remove the extra oil.<br>
7. Serve them hot!<br><br>

NOTES<br>
You can't make them in the oven, it doesn't work.<br>
You can't replace the flour with panko or such.<br>
Some people like adding sugar to the puffs, but I personally do not like them sweet.<br>
I had to use 'spheres' because of the Neopets filters.<br><img src="http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/612337461346959364/837893415705640990/Screen_Shot_2021-04-30_at_11.29.00_PM.png" width="390" border="2"><br><br><b>

If you are the <b>first</b> person to find Topsi that round, congratulations!!

<h2>1NP Shops</h2>
Why stop at <a href="/~exoduswebbie#auctions">1NP Auctions</a> when we could do 1NP Shops too?!!<br><br>
Look out for <b>Kenzie, Kelly and Samara</b> in the guild chat this week. They will be posting random times when their shops will be stocked entirely with items for 1NP!<br><br>
There will be some amazing items up for grabs so make sure you're quick!<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/757.gif"><br><br><b>The Shopkeeper says, "You don't want to miss this!</b>

<h2>Restocking Competition</h2>
<b>Saturday, April 10, 2021</b><br><b>6pm – 11pm NST</b><br><b>Points for Participation:</b>10pts per :00 (hour) that you're on<br><br><b>Prizes:</b> There are three categories of item prizes. <i>Most Profit Earned, MVP,</i> and <i> Beginner Restocker</i>. The prizes will be item prizes worth anywhere from 100k-500k.
<br><br>
You will be expected to record a list of all items you restock. It does not need to be screenshots, just text is fine. You will also be expected to record the <b>JELLYNEO</b> price next to the item name. We are choosing to use JN's database and price average because not all of our users have SSW – this keeps all the prices consistent and stable. <b>Normally, Jellyneo is not the law, Jacey is the law, but for restocking comp Jellyneo is the law.</b> (We are aware that the prices do fluctuate, and in the case that you restock an item that has been inflated, we can work out an exception.)<br><br>
All of this will be recorded on a petpage for the host, and should look like this:
<br><br>
Item name here, 59,432NP<br>
Item name here, 1,789 NP
<br><br><b>*We will not be taking into account what you spent on the item, but rather total worth of everything you restock.*</b>
<br><br>
For future competitions, we will change the timezone and day so that all of our members in different time zones can participate!

<div class="content"><div id="points">
<h2>Points Information</h2>
Over on the right, you'll see an updated list of points for all of our members. These are collected through the entire month of April – the competition will end on <b>April 30th</b>.<br><br><i>Points are updated every couple of days. Please be patient in between updates.</i> Multiple members are hosting activities, so it will take some time to collect all the point tallies.<br><br><h3>There are a few different ways to earn points!</h3><br>
The best way you'll be able to rack up your points is by participating in activities. We have three categories of activities: <i>monthly, bi-weekly, and board</i> and they all offer different amounts of points based on completion!<br><br>
We also award points to members who have gone above and beyond. Did someone make you a lookup, a font, or perhaps helped you code a page? Did someone grant one of your big NC or NP wishes? Did someone help you get your dream pet? <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=superkathiee">Please let Kat know!</a> You will receive points for letting me know, as well as the user who did the good deed.<br><br>
You can also earn points by donating to the guild. <a href="http://www.neopets.com/browseshop.phtml?owner=exodus_guild">CLICK HERE FOR OUR DONATION SHOP</a>! There will be an infographic in the shop that describes our current point-to-neopoint ratio and our donation cap per week. Donations are tallied every Saturday, and will reflect in your point count by the following Sunday.

<h2>Prize Pot</h2>
There will be <b>three</b> winners on April 30th. Instead of delegating certain rewards for each place, we have created a <i>prize pot</i>.<br><br><b>First place</b> will be allowed to choose <i>two</i> prizes from the pot: one graphic, and one np item. You will get first choice. You will also receive a bonus mystery gift from council.<br><br><b>Second place</b> will be allowed to choose <i>two</i> prizes from the remaining prize pot, after first place has chosen theirs: one graphic, and one np item. You will also receive a bonus mystery gift from council.<br><br><b>Third place</b> will be allowed to choose <i>one</i> prize from the remaining prize pot, after first place and second place have both chosen theirs. You will also receive a bonus mystery gift from council.<br><br>(Please not that the top 3 winners will <b>not</b> be eligible to redeem their points at the Prize Shop.)
