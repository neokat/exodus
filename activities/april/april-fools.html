      <br><br><h2>MEAT, MEAT, POTATO</h2>
<br>
This is a game for everyone! If someone goes to the Guild Chat (not for the other place please) and posts <b>IT'S RAINING POTATOES! /~BOB_BILLY_JOE#MEAT</b> the next three posts should be "meat", "meat" &  "potato." The person that types "potato" gets a potato shower from the OP (the one that posted that it's raining potatoes). *You cannot post twice in a row, but if you were the first "meat", you can be the one who posts "potato!<br><br>
Get out your umbrellas and get ready to smell like potato peels all month long!

<br><br><b>Prize</b>: Dung Petpet Paint Brush
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/petpetbrush_dung.gif"><p>
</p><h3>Participants</h3>

<br><b>El (elhiwe)</b><br>Growing up, every year for like 15 years on April Fool's I snuck down in the middle of the night and taped the sink sprayer button down, and EVERY SINGLE YEAR my dad turned the tap on full blast to fill the coffee pot in the morning and got sprayed with so much water he had to change his entire outfit. When I got too old, my kid brother continued the tradition. There was never a year my dad remembered in advance. I have very fond memories of him swearing and blustering around trying to find a towel and ranting at us for making him late.
<br><br><b>Laura (insidiousruin)</b><br>
OKAY so when I was younger my stepdad had a BMW that he was like.. obsessed with. Like next level, pride and joy, probably would have given up one of us kids instead of the car type love. And one April Fools we drove it around the corner and then woke him up telling him it was stolen. He.. didn't think it was funny and was about halfway through a phone call with the police before we were like UHHHH JKJKJK. And that is the story of how I got grounded forever.<br><br><b>Lynn, apostrasia</b><br>
Soo this isn't a crazy crazy prank but it can be really funny at times. Whenever I'm out and about with my fiance or when he's close enough to me I will legit (act) fall/faint. I will literally go limp as he tries to catch me and he literally freaks out every single time. Doing it in front of strangers is even funnier. Haven't gotten dropped yet but now he starts leaving me on the ground as he tries to walk away acting like he doesn't know me.
<br><br><b>Samara (hunni_bun_137)</b><br>
So I'm the oldest sister with 3 younger brothers. April fools was HUGE for us, but particularly for my brother who is only 18 months younger than me. It was the one day a year our parents would give us free reign. I did things like Mayonnaise in the lolly jar on the top shelf, bbq sauce mixed with cola and frozen into an icy block, glad wrap on the toilet etc. The year my brother turned 15, I decided to up my game, in the weeks leading up to April fools, I started stealing his socks... The morning of April fools, I got to his school early and I'd written in all of his socks with a sharpie, "if lost please return to 'my brother's name and class'", and I scattered them throughout his school, his friends helped too! In the teachers desks, in the bathrooms, in the hallways, I think one even ended up in the principals desk. And all day people were coming up to him bringing him his socks! But there were a few that didn't make it back on April fools and for the next couple of weeks he would randomly get people coming up to him with his socks :D My mum somehow managed to get the sharpie out of all but one sock who's mate never came home. I think she's still got it somewhere!<br><br><b>Dani (claimedxscribblez)</b><br>
So on April Fool's Day I thought I was being clever and I emptied out the salt shaker and put sugar in it. My mom made spaghetti for dinner that night and I hadn't screwed the cap on all the way and not only did she sprinkle sugar in the spaghetti, the lid fell into the spaghetti and about four tablespoons of sugar landed in the spaghetti. My mom was VERY angry LOL. She told me I had ruined dinner but I told her it wasn't ruined. I ate every bite of that sugar spaghetti.<br><br><b>Ice (honorrolle)</b><br>
My husband thought I went to bed, but I sat in the kitchen with all the lights off for 20 minutes crouched on the floor. When he finally made his way down the hall past the kitchen, I jumped out and yelled. The sound that emitted from that man's lung was other-wordly and woke up my mother in law and my kids. I've never heard a human make that kind of noise before.
