<h2>Welcome to Exodus' May Activity Page!</h2>
<h3>April showers bring May... greyscale flowers?! What? Where's all the color?</h3>

<h4>Participate in activities this month to restore our colorful guild to its full glory!<br><br>

This month, we are taking a break from our typical points system in favor of activities with a collective guild goal. There will be two big monthly activities: <b>Spotlight Spree</b> and <b>Recolor the Guild</b>, and 5 smaller activities updated every week. We are also introducing two new board games: <b>Saturday Game Time</b> and <b>Truth or Dare</b>.<br><br>

As you complete activities this month, you'll notice the guild layout and activity page start to come back to life!</h4><br>

<h2>Recolor the Guild</h2>
As you have definitely noticed by now, the guild is lacking some serious color. Grey Day really got to us, and Baelia the Grey Faerie made the guild match her personality. She told us that we can fix it, though—<b>it's up to us!</b><br><br>

The way to fix it is by <b>participating in activities</b>. Every time someone participates in an activity, the Grey Faerie is encouraged and her spirits are lifted. This activity is a <b>team sport</b>—we all win together! The only prize, of course, is bring the vivid colors back to the guild! <br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/342.gif"><br><br><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
The Grey Faerie's goal is for us to collectively earn <b>500 Color Points</b> during the month of May.<br><br><i>Well how the heck do you earn color points?!!?</i><br><br><b>ONE.</b> Participate in weekly activities (5 new activities/week, 1 person's participation = 1 color point)<br><b>TWO.</b> Participate in Spotlight Showdown (each spotlight ENTERED = 1 color point)<br><b>THREE.</b> Participate in our board activities (1 person's participation = 1 color point)<br><b>FOUR.</b> Post on the guild board! (Every 100 posts = 1 color point. Starting post count: <b>98,700</b>)<br><b>FOUR AND A HALF.</b> If we reach 100,000 total messages this month, the Grey Faerie will award an extra 25 color points!<br>
 <br><h4>ARE YOU UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?!?!?!</h4><br>

It's not all or nothing, though. As color points are earned, the meter below will fill up with color! As the meter is filled, more and more color will be returned to the guild. You will get to see your progress happen in real time! (About twice a week, but maybe more)

<h2>Spotlight Spree</h2>
This month our big activity is <b>SPOTLIGHT SPREE!</b> We are on a mission to enter as many site spotlights around neopets as we can to reach our collective goal as a guild: 50 spotlights entered in total, and 20 spotlights won. At the end of the month, we will have our very own <b>Exodus Newspaper</b> to show off everyone's beautiful submissions for the month! (And hopefully, our members will have a lot more trophies and NP prizes from those spotlight wins too!)
<br><br><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
You will earn stars for entering AND getting selected for any of the <a href="/contests.phtml">creative spotlights</a> listed below! Any spotlight you entered during the month of May counts, even if you entered earlier this week before this activity launched. Only one unique submission counts for each guild submission (for instance, you do not get multiple stars from entering the same art piece into the Art Gallery contest over and over—although it will likely help your chances to get picked by TNT if you enter multiple times!) You can only earn 1 submission star for each unique entry that you have.
<br><br><b>Eligible creative contests:</b> Art Gallery, User Lookup Spotlight, Neopian Times, Storytelling Contest, Poetry Gallery, and Gallery Spotlight
<br><br>
You must submit your piece to the relevant spotlight AND host your submission on a petpage and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail it to Kat</a> to earn your star for submission. At the end of the month, we will have an Exodus Newspaper to show off all of our work, whether it was selected for a spotlight or not! (Competition can be tough and it can be hard to get selected by TNT—don't give up!)
<br><br><h3>EARNING STARS</h3>
<b>Submit to a Spotlight:</b> +1 stars || make sure to neomail Kat with the form below<br><b>Selected for a Spotlight:</b> +2 stars || YOU WON! congrats! please neomail Kat with the form below<br><b>Jack of All Trades:</b> +5 stars || submit to the Big 4: Poetry, Art, Storytelling, & NT, and win at least one of them! <br><b>Guild reaches Spotlight Goals:</b> +10 stars || 10 stars for EVERYONE who participated by submitting to a spotlight when the guild reaches our montly goal of 50 submissions and 20 publications!<br><br><a href="#stars">Click here to see stars standings + how close we are to our guild goal!</a>
<br><br><h3>SUBMISSION FORMS</h3>
To send in your spotlight submission, fill out the form on the left and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail to Kat</a>. To report a spotlight win, fill out the form on the right and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">mail to Kat</a>!

You will receive prizes based on how many stars you reach. The prizes are LADDER STYLE, meaning you'll receive each prize when you reach that many stars! Prizes will be given out as soon as that points threshold has been reached. The prize ladder is as follows:
<br><br><b>1 star:</b> Random Beige Codestone (~2k-16k)<br><b>2 stars:</b> Random Red Codestone (~9k-45k)<br><b>3 stars:</b> Little Timmys Story or Tale of Woe: The Untold Story - by Reginald (Autographed Copy) (~50k)<br><b>5 stars:</b> Random Nerkmid (~75k)<br><b>8 stars:</b> Oil Paints Set or Painting on Easel (~100k)<br><b>13 stars:</b> Starry Paint Brush (~250k)<br><b>21 stars:</b> Shining Spotlight (~500k)
<br><br><b>BONUS PRIZE:</b> The person who receives the WORST NP prize from their spotlight (lowest JN price estimate at the very end of the month, excludes Neopian Times) will receive a MUCH BETTER NP prize (750k+) from the spotlight prize pool! If multiple people all receive the worst prize, they will all receive the same much better (750k+) item. (creative contest spotlight pool: jellyneo.net/?go=contestprizes)

<h2>Better Than Kat</h2>
    It's about to be a month FULL of games with the Altater Cup approaching... and idk about you, but I am feeling <i>pretty rusty</i> at the good ole neopets games. So this week we are playing <b>Better Than Kat</b> with one of the only converted games on this website: <a href="/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1390">Ice Cream Machine!</a>
    <br><br>
    The score of mine to beat is <b>5240</b>!<br><br>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778020122916159540/846883271647952946/unknown.png" width="300">
<br><br>
    Please note that the activity is only for the <b>converted version</b>  of <a href="/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1390">Ice Cream Machine</a>. It is different than the old game scoring wise and not everyone in the guild still has access to flash, so this is to keep it fair for everyone. The new version does take some getting used to, so <b>keep scrolling for tips!!</b> <br><br>
    To submit your score, take a screenshot of your score that beats Kat's score of <b>5240</b>, slap it on a petpage, and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail it to Kat</a> (or send via another way that is easy for you).<br><br>
    <h3>PRIZES</h3>
    For beating Kat's score, you will receive <b>Super Ice Cream Machine Background</b> (~40k).<br>
    If you get REALLY GOOD and beat the avatar score of <b>14,500</b>, in addition to your shiny new avatar, you will also receive <b>Games Master Challenge Stamp
</b> (~135k)!<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h3>GAME TIPS FROM MAI</h3>
- Don’t speed up AND especially don’t slow down. The speed power ups don’t change the rate at which the scoops drop. Slowing down means more scoops pile up and are on the screen. Speeding up can be useful since there’s fewer scoops on the screen but on the harder levels it’s a little too fast for my little brain to handle. <br>
- Tips for using trackpad/mouse: have Adee halfway between the scoops and the bottom of the screen. Your cursor will then always be in the screen. Have the cursor too low and your chances of accidentally dragging the cursor out of the screen during critical moments is really high. <br>
- Restart the first level until you get some fish/apple bonuses or an extra life. <br>
- IMPORTANT tip: Have some music on. Having a beat to mindlessly follow can help dodge scoops especially in the higher levels.<br><br>

<h2>Saturday Game Time</h2><br><b>SATURDAY! SATURDAY! SATURDAY!</b> Do you dream of getting absolutely crushed by El in Pictionary? Do you too wish you could take out your anger on your fellow guildren in a fun, who-done-it style game called Among Us? Do you want to see which potatoes are secretly cynical and unhinged in a totally not neopets-related game of Cards Against Humanity? Are you ready to have your entire spirit crushed by Tiara in a game of Avatar Simon?<br><br>

Join us <b>every Saturday</b> for a few hours of games!<br><br>
We'll try to start around <b>NOON NST</b> so that our spuddies far and wide can try to join in on the fun!<br><br>

Hosted by Amelia (imgonnageta) - <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=imgonnageta">neomail</a> for more information

<h2>Truth or Dare?</h2>
Truth or Dare is BACK BABY! We had so much fun with it that we are doing it again.<br><br>

At any point during the day, <b>Kat</b> or <b>Lynn</b> can hop onto the board and ask the age old question: <b>truth or dare?</b><br><br>

Everyone who is around that answers within a ~10 minute window will be able to answer with their choice of truth or dare. You will then be given a truth or dare to complete by either Kat or Lynn. If you complete the task, you win a prize. If you fail the task, well......... we aren't going to talk about what happens if you fail :) Because you won't :) Right? :)<br><br>

Your truth could be as simple as "what was your favorite neopet when you first started playing?" or as saucy as "tell me your most unpopular opinion about UCs." The dares can be funny, like "set your avatar to I'm Smelly and use it as your default font for 24 hours" or they can be totally involved, requiring you to make silly boards on the AC or post a propaganda message on the board every time someone asks as simple a question as "how are you?" to the group.<br><br>

Truths and dares and their resulting answers or success/failure status will be posted here for all to see!<br><br>

The prize for completing a TRUTH will be greyscale and dull, while the prize for completing a DARE will be a lot more colorful!<br><br><h3>PRIZES</h3><b>Successfully completing a truth:</b> Grey Faerie Card (~20k)<br><b>Successfully completing a dare:</b> Rainbow Negg Plushie (~45k)
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/blacktradingcardback.gif"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_plushie_negg_rainbow.gif"><br><br><b>NOTE:</b> you are eligible to complete more than one truth or dare, but you may only have one ACTIVE truth or dare at a time. That means you can't get another truth or dare while you are still completing the first one!<br><br><br>
