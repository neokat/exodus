<h2>Welcome to Exodus' May Activity Page!</h2>
<h3>April showers bring May... greyscale flowers?! What? Where's all the color?</h3>

<h4>Participate in activities this month to restore our colorful guild to its full glory!<br><br>

This month, we are taking a break from our typical points system in favor of activities with a collective guild goal. There will be two big monthly activities: <b>Spotlight Spree</b> and <b>Recolor the Guild</b>, and 5 smaller activities updated every week. We are also introducing two new board games: <b>Saturday Game Time</b> and <b>Truth or Dare</b>.<br><br>

As you complete activities this month, you'll notice the guild layout and activity page start to come back to life!</h4><br>

<h2>Recolor the Guild</h2>
As you have definitely noticed by now, the guild is lacking some serious color. Grey Day really got to us, and Baelia the Grey Faerie made the guild match her personality. She told us that we can fix it, though—<b>it's up to us!</b><br><br>

The way to fix it is by <b>participating in activities</b>. Every time someone participates in an activity, the Grey Faerie is encouraged and her spirits are lifted. This activity is a <b>team sport</b>—we all win together! The only prize, of course, is bring the vivid colors back to the guild! <br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/342.gif"><br><br><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
The Grey Faerie's goal is for us to collectively earn <b>500 Color Points</b> during the month of May.<br><br><i>Well how the heck do you earn color points?!!?</i><br><br><b>ONE.</b> Participate in weekly activities (5 new activities/week, 1 person's participation = 1 color point)<br><b>TWO.</b> Participate in Spotlight Showdown (each spotlight ENTERED = 1 color point)<br><b>THREE.</b> Participate in our board activities (1 person's participation = 1 color point)<br><b>FOUR.</b> Post on the guild board! (Every 100 posts = 1 color point. Starting post count: <b>98,700</b>)<br><b>FOUR AND A HALF.</b> If we reach 100,000 total messages this month, the Grey Faerie will award an extra 25 color points!<br>
 <br><h4>ARE YOU UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?!?!?!</h4><br>

It's not all or nothing, though. As color points are earned, the meter below will fill up with color! As the meter is filled, more and more color will be returned to the guild. You will get to see your progress happen in real time! (About twice a week, but maybe more)

<h2>Spotlight Spree</h2>
This month our big activity is <b>SPOTLIGHT SPREE!</b> We are on a mission to enter as many site spotlights around neopets as we can to reach our collective goal as a guild: 50 spotlights entered in total, and 20 spotlights won. At the end of the month, we will have our very own <b>Exodus Newspaper</b> to show off everyone's beautiful submissions for the month! (And hopefully, our members will have a lot more trophies and NP prizes from those spotlight wins too!)
<br><br><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
You will earn stars for entering AND getting selected for any of the <a href="/contests.phtml">creative spotlights</a> listed below! Any spotlight you entered during the month of May counts, even if you entered earlier this week before this activity launched. Only one unique submission counts for each guild submission (for instance, you do not get multiple stars from entering the same art piece into the Art Gallery contest over and over—although it will likely help your chances to get picked by TNT if you enter multiple times!) You can only earn 1 submission star for each unique entry that you have.
<br><br><b>Eligible creative contests:</b> Art Gallery, User Lookup Spotlight, Neopian Times, Storytelling Contest, Poetry Gallery, and Gallery Spotlight
<br><br>
You must submit your piece to the relevant spotlight AND host your submission on a petpage and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail it to Kat</a> to earn your star for submission. At the end of the month, we will have an Exodus Newspaper to show off all of our work, whether it was selected for a spotlight or not! (Competition can be tough and it can be hard to get selected by TNT—don't give up!)
<br><br><h3>EARNING STARS</h3>
<b>Submit to a Spotlight:</b> +1 stars || make sure to neomail Kat with the form below<br><b>Selected for a Spotlight:</b> +2 stars || YOU WON! congrats! please neomail Kat with the form below<br><b>Jack of All Trades:</b> +5 stars || submit to the Big 4: Poetry, Art, Storytelling, & NT, and win at least one of them! <br><b>Guild reaches Spotlight Goal:</b> +10 stars || 10 stars for EVERYONE who participated by submitting to a spotlight when the guild reaches their goal!<br><br><a href="#stars">Click here to see stars standings + how close we are to our guild goal!</a>

You will receive prizes based on how many stars you reach. The prizes are LADDER STYLE, meaning you'll receive each prize when you reach that many stars! Prizes will be given out as soon as that points threshold has been reached. The prize ladder is as follows:
<br><br><b>1 star:</b> Random Beige Codestone (~2k-16k)<br><b>2 stars:</b> Random Red Codestone (~9k-45k)<br><b>3 stars:</b> Little Timmys Story or Tale of Woe: The Untold Story - by Reginald (Autographed Copy) (~50k)<br><b>5 stars:</b> Random Nerkmid (~75k)<br><b>8 stars:</b> Oil Paints Set or Painting on Easel (~100k)<br><b>13 stars:</b> Starry Paint Brush (~250k)<br><b>21 stars:</b> Shining Spotlight (~500k)
<br><br><b>BONUS PRIZE:</b> The person who receives the WORST NP prize from their spotlight (lowest JN price estimate at the very end of the month, excludes Neopian Times) will receive a MUCH BETTER NP prize (750k+) from the spotlight prize pool! If multiple people all receive the worst prize, they will all receive the same much better (750k+) item. (creative contest spotlight pool: jellyneo.net/?go=contestprizes)

 <h3>THE ENTRIES</h3><br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4dSwpKf/pjimage.jpg">
<br><br>


<b>Item 1: Gross Rainbow Cough Drop - Julia (juliadoglover11405)</b><br>
Try every flavor at once making your mouth a lovely shade of brown.
<br><br>

<b>Item 1: Fool's Soap - Kat (superkathiee) </b><br>
This beautiful shiny rainbow item might ~look~ like it is a bar of soap, but it is not. In fact, using it to wash your hands with might actually make them more dirty. Studies have shown that it is -15% effective in preventing Neezles. However, it's extremely beautiful and certainly deserves to be displayed in your bathroom for all of your guests to see (but not use)!
<br> <br>

<b>Item 1: Stone of Celebration - Lau (Pequepanda) </b><br>
Item type: Battledome weapon <br>
Restocks at: Battle Magic <br>
Description: Celebrate your Neopet's identity by throwing this stone at the face of those who don't LIKE it!
<br> <br>

<b>Item 1: Magic Theft Stone - Christy (merpiie)</b> <br>
Hey Mr. Museum Curator! You need this Magic Theft Stone for that rare gem museum of yours! It is the perfect distraction to sit right next to your Ancient Dacardite Necklace you have in your collection, so that any robbers will be distracted by your magic theft stone instead, and break the glass for that instead of your precious collection! So, say how bout it? How about a small price of 5,000 nps?
<br> <br>

<b>Item 1: Personality Stone - Lynn (apostrasia) </b><br>
Are you feeling dull? Do you think you need a personality reading? Or are you just a potato? What are you waiting for,  find out today by purchasing the Personality Stone! <br> <br>



<b>Item 2: Slippery Laughter Ink - Kelly (hilary_duff_fan_16) </b><br>
This inky substance is the ultimate necessity of arena warfare! Watch as your opponent slips and slides around the battlefield while you enjoy some restful healing time. Guaranteed to make your opponent dizzy and the crowd laugh!

<br> <br>
<b>Item 3: Spinny Spoon of Restitution - Ice (honorrolle) </b>
<br>
Nothing is worse than a bad trade deal or a sniper that sweeps up a incorrectly-priced item. But my friend, you are in luck, because today I have something that you absolutely need in your neo-life. The Spinny Spoon of Restitution convinces the slinky snipers to not only return the item they so rudely sniped to your detriment, but to pay interest, handling fees and other spoon-mandated expenses. Once the SSoR is done with the snipers, they will wish they never started sniping in the first place.
<br> <br>

<b>Item 3: Spiral Club - Aik (aikuanda)</b><br>
For when TNT refuses to punish thieving users- use this club! The spiral coil allows the club to bounce back and hit the thief not just once but twice!
<br> <br>

Battle Weapon <br>
Capture your enemies voices with this shiny device. A multiuse item that can also be used for everyday things, such as cooking for and scolding your neopet!
<br> <br>
<b>Item 3: Vegetable Twister Spoon - Vanessa (hummush) </b> <br>
Description: Struggling to get your serves of vegetables in? Eating vegetables with this spoon will magically twist their flavour and make them all taste like delicious, fried potatoes! Mmm.. carbs.
<br> <br>
<b>Item 3: The Wandering Neopian's Twisted Adventure Ladle - Rhi (cymrhi)</b><br>
The best friend of any adventurous Neopian, the Twisted Adventure Ladle will spoon you out of trouble in a pinch! WARNING: Usage may cause a saga-inspiring, unexpected journey.
<br> <br>

<b>Item 4: Queens Monarch Stress-Be-gone Pen - Kenzie (mrsinvicta) </b>

You get teleported to the destination of your dreams! This can be anywhere in the WORLD!? You want to see Channing Tatum in his birthday suit?
We got you! All you gotta do is dream it while using the pen!
<br>

<h2>Mom Day Matching</h2>
<b>This activity will expire on Tuesday, May 18 at midnight NST.</b><br><br>
 Last week we had you send us in the "perfect" mom day for you! Now it's your turn to guess who these moms/fur moms/potatoes with a perfect day are!! Below you will find all the entries from last week and the members who sent them, in but they need to be matched up! <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=mrsinvicta">Neomail your guesses to Kenzie.</a>
<br><br>
 <h3>PRIZES</h3>
 Just for participating, you will receive a random Dubloon! If you get them all right on your first try, you will receive:  Glowing Bath Tub (~345k)<br><br>
 <img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/dubloon4.gif"><img src="https://images.neopets.com/items/fur_tub_glowing.gif">
<br><br>
 <h3>THE ENTRIES</h3>
<b>ONE.</b> I would pretend I was going to relax and then after like 30 minutes be so bored that I'd give up and run out 14 times to pick up takeout, do an errand, buy art supplies, see a friend, attend a lecture, etc.
<br><br>
<b>TWO.</b> Eat some  nachos and chocolate milk, play skribbl with some potatoes, get my eyebrows waxed, go for a swim and fall asleep cuddled in a blanket fresh out of the dryer.
<br><br>
<b>THREE.</b> A perfect Mom Day for me would include self care! Whether it be a massage, facial, getting fillers, or hair appointment along with a shopping day and binge watching my present fave show with the pups!
<br><br>
<b>FOUR.</b> here is my ideal me day (same thing for non mums I would say xD): Sleeping in, continue reading some fanfic while still in bed, getting up to watch youtube on my laptop, getting someone else to cook for me, sitting in the garden when the weather is nice, play and cuddle with my cats, going into the bathtub, reading, and going to bed after a whole day of doing nothing productive
<br><br>
<b>FIVE.</b> I think if we were post pandemic, my perfect mom day would be a nice weekend (or really even a week day) in which I could go out with my friends to brunch and then enjoy some drinks on a patio. Maybe after that a movie and snacks! And of course some sort of over the top horrible food for you for dinner to top it off!
<br><br>
<b>SIX.</b> I would travel to see something new with hubs, watch a new movie in a theater, take a hike, do some weight lifting, play the drums and hang out with some friends!
<br><br>
<b>SEVEN.</b> What I would do on a day for myself; I would probably try to make a list of ideas for myself but still end up on neopets or end up trying to organize / clean something. I don't really have days to myself, It's always something! xD
<br><br>
<b>EIGHT.</b> The perfect me day from a non-mom would be going to play basketball in the morning, then coming home, and spending lots of time relaxing in the tub! An evening walk to relax the mind, and then melt my brain watching something haha! And of course, lots of good food!
<br><br>
<b>NINE.</b> The perfect mother's Day for me would be sleeping in, having my husband get all the kids ready and going out for the day to a zoo or family activity
<br><br>
<b>TEN.</b> On a day all for myself, I would start the day with a nice cup of coffee and spend as much time as I want on Neopets. Then I'd love to go for a walk to the shopping centre with no intentions to buy anything really, just for a nice browse. And it'd be perfect to end the day with a nice homecooked meal!

<h2>Baelia's Creative Corner</h2>
 <b>This activity will expire on Tuesday, May 18 at midnight NST.</b><br><br>
 Baelia has challenged us to <b>recolor the guild</b> this month. Now she wants you see how you would recolor Faerieland!<br><br>

 In this Creative Corner, choose one of the <a href="/faerieland/faerie_colour.phtml">Faerieland coloring pages by clicking here.</a> Color it however you like, whether it's digital or traditional, crayon or color pencil or painting. BUT! Baelia's rule is that you CANNOT use any greyscale colors (grey, black, or white) - and yes, this means you need to color the entire page! (Baby spuds are very welcome to color something with their potato parents and they don't have to follow any of Baelia's silly rules :))<br><br>

 When you are finished with your artwork, stick it on a petpage and <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">neomail it to Kat</a> (or send it via another method that's easier for you).

<h2>Altador Cup Sign Ups</h2>
  <b>This activity will expire on Tuesday, May 18 at midnight NST.</b> (You will still be able to join a team with the guild and participate in the guild Altador Cup activities, but after May 17 you won't be able to communicate the team that you are loyal to )<br><br>

The Altador Cup is quickly approaching and we're preparing some great activities that will be focused around it (don't worry, we'll be including some of our regular guild activities as well!)<br><br>
For us to determine our main guild teams, we need everyone to fill out the form below and  <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=aikuanda">neomail it to Aik</a>.<br><br>
<b>1.</b> Are you loyal to an Altador Cup Team? If so, which team? (Then skip to question 3.)<br>
<b>2.</b> If no team loyalty, are you okay with the guild assigning you one to join? Is there a team you DON'T want to join?<br>
<b>3.</b> When was the last time you played in the AC and what was your rank?<br>
<b>4.</b> Which rank do you hope to hit this year?<br><br>

  <b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> If your loyalties lie with one team, <b>we want you to join that team!</b> We are simply trying to find out which teams our members are loyal to so that we can do our best to distribute the people who want to join a team with the guild as evenly as possible!

<h2>Saturday Game Time</h2><br><b>SATURDAY! SATURDAY! SATURDAY!</b> Do you dream of getting absolutely crushed by El in Pictionary? Do you too wish you could take out your anger on your fellow guildren in a fun, who-done-it style game called Among Us? Do you want to see which potatoes are secretly cynical and unhinged in a totally not neopets-related game of Cards Against Humanity? Are you ready to have your entire spirit crushed by Tiara in a game of Avatar Simon?<br><br>

Join us <b>every Saturday</b> for a few hours of games!<br><br>
We'll try to start around <b>NOON NST</b> so that our spuddies far and wide can try to join in on the fun!<br><br>

Hosted by Amelia (imgonnageta) - <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=imgonnageta">neomail</a> for more information

<div class="content"><div id="dare">
<h2>Truth or Dare?</h2>
Truth or Dare is BACK BABY! We had so much fun with it that we are doing it again.<br><br>

At any point during the day, <b>Kat</b> or <b>Lynn</b> can hop onto the board and ask the age old question: <b>truth or dare?</b><br><br>

Everyone who is around that answers within a ~10 minute window will be able to answer with their choice of truth or dare. You will then be given a truth or dare to complete by either Kat or Lynn. If you complete the task, you win a prize. If you fail the task, well......... we aren't going to talk about what happens if you fail :) Because you won't :) Right? :)<br><br>

Your truth could be as simple as "what was your favorite neopet when you first started playing?" or as saucy as "tell me your most unpopular opinion about UCs." The dares can be funny, like "set your avatar to I'm Smelly and use it as your default font for 24 hours" or they can be totally involved, requiring you to make silly boards on the AC or post a propaganda message on the board every time someone asks as simple a question as "how are you?" to the group.<br><br>

Truths and dares and their resulting answers or success/failure status will be posted here for all to see!<br><br>

The prize for completing a TRUTH will be greyscale and dull, while the prize for completing a DARE will be a lot more colorful!<br><br><h3>PRIZES</h3><b>Successfully completing a truth:</b> Grey Faerie Card (~20k)<br><b>Successfully completing a dare:</b> Rainbow Negg Plushie (~45k)
<br><br><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/blacktradingcardback.gif"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_plushie_negg_rainbow.gif"><br><br><b>NOTE:</b> you are eligible to complete more than one truth or dare, but you may only have one ACTIVE truth or dare at a time. That means you can't get another truth or dare while you are still completing the first one!<br><br><br>
