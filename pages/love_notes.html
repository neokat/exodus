      <br><h2>Welcome to Exodus' Love Notes!</h2>

<p>
We've grown so extremely close as a guild, and have developed friendships that are literally unrivaled by our real life ones. We love each and every one of you SO much, and want there to be a way to acknowledge the things you do.
</p><p>
Please <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=superkathiee">NEOMAIL KAT</a> with anonymous notes about your fellow guildies. Your username will not be shared with whatever you submit.
</p><p>

<h3>VIEWING LOVE NOTES</h3>
        <p>Love notes are organized <b>alphabetically by first name</b> (e.g. Kat's notes will be under K for Kat, Jamie's under J for Jamie) and listed in roughly the order received. (The transition of the notes from the <a href="/~Rhedle">activities</a> page to this new Love Notes page shuffled the original ones up a bit - but all new notes will be added in the order received!)

<h2>To ALL of Exodus</h2>
<p>
Everyone is so lovely and I want to especially thank El and Christy for being so kind, warm and welcoming. Something about these two just makes my heart light up when I see them on the boards. I just remember a few times popping on to the boards in a rough moment and these two always stand out to me as people who rally around you when you are feeling down and lift you up. Thank you ladies, love you!
</p><p>
Exodus - Where to start... each and every one of you guys has made life in quarantine so much better and have touched me in some way. Even though this isn't addressed to anyone in particular (I did do separate notes!), I just wanted to take time to say as a guild, you guys have made me realized that I have all the friends I need. You guys treat me with so much love and respect, and are all so supportive of me and my goals! I love that you guys are here for my good days, and my bad and want to walk through both those days with me by my side. I love you all so much from the bottom of my heart, and cannot wait to tell you all in person.
</p><p>
To all my Exodus babies, Each of you are such down to earth people, and have played a significant role in my life. To say you are just friends to me would be an understatement, because I treat you guys like family. Although i've seen some of you at your worst, and like wise I still see a beautiful human being growing their wings ready to go and make their mark on each people they come in contact with especially how you've made your mark onto me. I love you all. May your christmas be filled with love, laughter, and joy. xoxo
</p><p>
To all of exodus: you guys are seriously the only reason I have survived this quarantine. Having a real escape from all the responsibilities, stress and social isolation of my real life is a life saver. This community is wonderful and every single person here makes this a better place. I want to know all of you better. I love that this is an inclusive place where no one is ever left out and new people are always welcome. I love that everyone makes an effort to be present and participate. Avatar collecting and customizing pets would not be half as fun without other people to laugh about it with!!
</p><p>
To every person in Exodus: Thank you so much for making Neopia a much funnier and friendlier place. You never fail to put the goofiest smile on my face and I feel so privileged to have found y'all and for you to have accepted me as a member! You are all so talented and lovely in your own special way, and there's no other website I'd rather waste my time on as long as you'll be around here.Special big shout out to everyone who helps run the guild's activities and design. Also to Min, Kat, Jamie, Ari, Melly, Sosu, Samara, Misa and Alex (mainly because they seem to be in a good timezone fit for me, so I get to interact with them more!!)
</p><p>
To everyone in Exodus, without you guys, I would've probably left neo again. I came back earlier this year and never thought I'd enjoy playing this much as an adult. Having you guys to talk to each and everyday is one of the highlights of my day, I'm not even kidding.
</p><p>
To everyone in Exodus: I'd of likely left this site by now if it weren't for being a part of such a lovely community with all of you. When I lost my main this place momentarily lost its purpose for me, to be an escape from the stress of outside life when it got to be too much. You guys were amazingly supportive and kind throughout my whole rebuilding process though, and I can't thank you enough. I know the chat moves fast but I've never seen anyone left out if they post to say hi or anything like that, and it really speaks to the type of people you all are (super lovely ones, that is). You all deserve the absolute best, both here & outside of neo, don't ever forget it.
</p><p>
To Exodus as a whole: Since I've joined and came across this bunch of wonderful people, I knew I found my perfect guild match. We literally share laughter, tears, and accomplishments with each other. I have never felt more supported with AI goals as well as IRL events. Thank you all for being you.
I want to thank everyone in the guild who has been there for me in supporting me when I was going through tough times. All of you mean so much to me, and I couldn't ask for a better guild or better friends.
</p><p>
To the guild: Thank you all SO much for being who you are. After coming back to neo I never thought I would join a guild and stick around, but you are all so kind and fun to chat with that now I couldn't imagine neo without you! You've pushed me to be more active and to actually go for things I never thought I could achieve on this site! I can't wait to continue celebrating your accomplishments and being there for you guys with whatever neo or life throws your way!

<h2>A, B, & C</h2>
<p>




</p><h3>AIK, aikuanda</h3><p>

Aik, i LOVE getting to chat with you in the other place!
</p><p>

</p><h3>AMELIA, imgonnageta</h3><p>

Amelia (imgonnageta): Neither words nor time would allow me to express how much you mean to me, Amy. By calling you my sis I feel I get closer to how I feel about you and the love I have for everything you have done for me. We have gone through a lot, nearly 15 years of friendship, countless of funny moments, lived through many dramas, survived many apocalyptic moments, and here we are always there for each other. You know EVERYTHING, you know that I love you so much and that I'll never stop until we can finally meet. The pandemic got us this year but I'm sure we'll do it!!
</p><p>
        Amelia, i absolutely adore you. thank you for being a big part of me being so active in neo and referring me to exodus!
</p><p>


</p><h3>ARIANA, lockheaarts</h3><p>
Ari - You seriously always cra.ck me right up. Your jokes, conniving, and general sass are just so good. I love that you are always starting shenanigans. Anything is a good time if you're a part of it!!
</p><p>
Ari - You were one of the first people I met when I came back to neo. I admire you for being strong and independent. I see people like you as a hero. For giving your time and risking your life to help save people with the rona. You are generous and witty and you deserve to find someone who will love you for you.
</p><p>
Ari- You are a real life hero and I enjoy talking to you.
Ariana, you're so full of energy and happiness and sarcasm, and it's such a good mix of everything. Every conversation I have with you has been so fun, and a wild ride.
</p><p>
I genuinely think that if Ari & me met IRL, we'd get on like a house on fire! She's super bubbly, definitely has a good (my) kinda humour, she's always supportive & got your back & brings so much life to the guild. Thank you for being you, Ari!
</p><p>
Ari - Nothin' can bring you down. Can't wait to slam neocolas with you in the future ~*~
</p><p>


</p><h3>CHLOE, xbebechloex</h3><p>
Chloe might be fairlyyyy new here, but her prescence has never failed to make me giggle! Her humour often makes me LOL & she has such a lovely personality. She's completely gelled & I hope she stays for a while!
</p><p>
Chloe, we haven't had many opportunities to chat in the guild (I think due to time zone differences) but the few times I've caught you online_ you've been so sweet and had a great sense of humour! I love that about you!
</p><p>
Chloe, well, you have waltzed in here like you own the place... and quickly become one of my favourite people. You are hilarious AND ridiculously generous?! I guess you are my glucose guardian now… Thanks for bringing a bit o' British humour to the gaff too so someone understands Come Dine With Me, Louis Theroux and what a Yorkshire pudding is. Long may it continue.
</p><p>
Chloe! Thank you for being part of this group! You are a sweet person and really fun to chat with. I am looking forward to getting to know you better!
</p><p>
Chloe - You are one of the kindest people I've met on neo and you always share your wins with the guild. We don't chat much, but when we do you're always so happy and it makes my day better!
</p><p>
Chloe - You have such funny anecdotes and the slang that you use makes me literally laugh out loud!!
</p><p>

</p><h3>CHRISSY, filotimo</h3><p>
Chrissy - Chrissy, you are such a warm and welcoming person! I was very nervous about joining a new guild and getting to know a whole new group of people, but you made me feel at ease and welcome right away. You have a very kind way of including people on the messaging boards and are just lots of fun to chat with... I am so pleased we joined the guild around the same time!
</p><p>
Chrissy - To my Christmas loving friend! You are so fun to chat with and I'm so glad I've gotten to meet you through Exodus  You've already challenged me to grow here on the site and I can't thank you enough for that!
</p><p>



</p><h3>CHRISTY, merpiie</h3><p>
Christy- You are a one woman wonder on the competitive auctions, you've got fast fancy fingers on that keyboard. You are destroying the games and racking in the trophies. #Darkhorse #snowballer
</p><p>
Christy, you rock! Just straight up. I love that you have so many cool interests. You really get the most out of life. And you keep this guild happening. I feel like nothing can stop you when you set your mind to something bc you do not take no for an answer! You're a b.a.m.f (can I say that on here?)
</p><p>
Merpiie (Christy): I've seen you around but never had the pleasure to get to know you as much as I did in my short time in the guild. I'm more than thankful for the immense support you have given me, for making other people's problem your problem and helping everyone, myself included, overcome them. You are always there and that's something I truly treasure. Behind this strong, trust-worthy and confidence woman lays an amazing, overall funny person I love watching on tube whenever I need to cheer myself up.
</p><p>
Christy - Master bidder! I love that I can count on you for anything!
</p><p>



</p><h3>CORY, xxsitrus</h3><p>
Cory - you have an amazing sense of humour, (my fav is your citrus / sitrus pun you had on your font!). You're super great to hang out with in the guild, and always a good competition in the auctions xD
</p><p>
I love to see Cory on the guild chat because of his witty comments he makes nonchalantly about things. I usually LOL at least a few times during a conversation with Cory. He's always willing to help out where he can when he's not busy getting lost on DTI xD
</p><p>
Cory - In this crazy guild, I appreciate your calm, chill, energy. And I love that we can talk about anything!
</p>

</p><h3>EL, elhiwe</h3><p>
El, thank you for joining this guild! I love seeing you pop in and brighten up the boards with your kindness and fun presence. I love that you're so friendly and genuine AND amazing with the activities!
</p><p>
El - You are so kind and instantly bring a smile to my face! I'm so glad we've been able to chat and lament about our avvie woes together
</p><p>
      El - I love that we are starting to talk more because getting to know you has been such a hoot! You have such an interesting life and funny stories!
</p><p>



</p><h3>EMBER, i_will_always_luv_me</h3><p>
Ember - you are so cool and fun. You are tough as nails for surviving the cut-throat world of NC boards and UC trading. And, you know, all the real-life hardships you've overcome. Your honesty and humility are really refreshing and I appreciate that you are willing to be vulnerable. So many people pretend to be something they aren't and that is never you!
</p><p>
Ember - You're one of the nicest persons I've met on neo. You're always there to offer help and advice despite all the craziness that goes on in your daily life. You customize the heck out of your pets and really go for what you want, even though it could take a while.. Your determination and customization ski.lls are some things to be admired, that's for sure. You're generous and kind and hardworking, you deserve all you have in the world and more.
</p><p>
Ember is one of the strongest people I see in this guild! Everything from her military past, to her current job, to explaining or admitting she suffers from PTSD. What an amazing girl, we're lucky to have you ~ you seem like an amazingly hard worker, extremely motivated, & ridiculously strong-minded. I'd love to be like you!
</p><p>
Ember, your story wows me. We've known each other for over a year now, and your story about your past makes me admire you so much more. You never complain - I could seriously never take that many busses and still keep that positive mindset. You're all around such a good person, and I love getting to know you.
</p><p>
Ember, thank you for helping me and being there for me.
</p><p>
Ember - I love that you are 100% yourself and are so easy to talk to! I'm also insanely glad that we tend to be on around the same time because I feel like my early morning chatting isn't the same without you!

</p><h3>GRACIE, butseriously</h3><p>
Gracie - you're so nice and sweet, and always bring a smile to my face! You care about everyone and ask how we are doing because you care. I feel like I can always tell you about my day, and I know you will always follow up with more questions and just want to hear about what's going on with me. You don't find that quality in a lot of people, and I love that you do it
</p><p>
Gracie is that friend that will always hype you up!! She has a sweet and caring nature to her that makes her easy to get along with! She's another member who brings good laughs to the guild.
</p><p>
Gracie, you are the sweetest sweetheart! You are honestly one of the kindest people on the guild, I love how much you always remember what everyone has told you about themselves and always check in on life outside neo. I also appreciate your humour, and the fact you laugh at my jokes. I am always so happy when I see you on the boards as I know we are going to have some fun.
</p><p>


</p><h3>ICE, honorrolle</h3><p>

I really admire and appreciate Ice's positivity and kindness. She is sweet, kind, and caring. Despite obstacles that may be thrown her way, she is one of the most strongest people I've ever crossed paths with!
</p><p>
Ice, watching your progress in the guild getting to 300 avatars, smashing the games, coming out of your shell, hosting all your own FC bets!! Your account improvement has legit taken off & it's been SO AMAZING watching all of your milestones or achievements! Keep it up, & thank you so much for the support you always give myself & others too. You're an angel!!
</p><p>
Ice, you are a incredibly resilient and optimistic person and I love that you stay kind, positive and loving even when things get tough. You seem like an awesome mom who puts in a lot of effort for her kids!
</p><p>
Ice, you are so talented! I loved reading your NT times submission, and it was so well written it blew me away. It was the perfect mix of witty and informative, and I loved your personality shining through your writing!
</p><p>
      Ice - Our Food Club wizard!! I love how you set and achieve neogoals for yourself but also help us with our own!
</p><p>
        Ice, You are super sweet and friendly, I always enjoy chatting with you. Thank you for always reminding us to do our dailies and supporting us!

</p><p>
Jacey - the reason for large fonts! haha you have an amazing sense of humour and always make me laugh!

      Jacey - WE NEED MORE JACEY!
</p><p>

</p><h3>JACQUELINE, thevampirelestat_x</h3><p>

</p><p>

</p><h3>JAE, ferulax</h3><p>

Jae - you are a really kind person and super chill. You're just so easy to get along with - I love "hanging out" with you online_ I am so excited for your little one to come along. I am glad that after all you've been through, you get to have this little happily ever after family :)
</p><p>
Jae- you are a wonderwoman and are already an awesome potato mom to little tot. I'm sorry we have to share some parts of our medical journey, but at least we have each other to be strong with!
</p><p>
Jae, I can't wait til you're "officially" a mom. I can already tell you're gonna be great! You're so supportive of me, and my passions, even from miles away! I love that about you!
</p><p>
Jae, I know you've been really sick and having some complications, but the way you are a warrior about it is so inspirational! You're always willing to talk to other members about their own lives and stories and the way you connect so personally with everyone is a personality trait that is to die for. Thank you for being such a genuine person ALL the time, no matter how *dung* you may be feeling!
</p><p>
      Jae, the story of your relationship also helped me a lot too, it gives me hope.
</p><p>
      Jae - We don't talk a lot but you've got the sweetest energy!
</p><p>
         Jae, you are so funny and you always make me laugh out loud. The exodus history book with us mashing potatoes with our feet will forever be etched in my mind.
</p><p>

</p><h3>JAMIE, goosesticks</h3><p>

Exactly like someone said above goose, just because you're hosting doesn't mean you don't get a paragraph! It baffles me sometimes that even though we haven't met, I can literally feel your WARMTH through the screen ~ you always seem to know exactly what to say to be an amazing friend. When anyone is down, or needs cheering up, you're there for advice in the nicest way ~ OR you're the happiest, making everybody giggle, bundle of energy. It's like a gift, I'd love to have a personality like you! You're a completely amazing person & everything you do for the guild does not go unnoticed. All of us appreciate you like nothing else! You're the best!
</p><p>
GAMIE, thank you so much for taking me under your wing and teaching me the cool ropes of ~NC~. You enabled me to spend my entire paycheck on NC, but that's okay!!! You are such a strong and sweet individual. Thank you for making FETCH (Exodus) HAPPEN! Love you lots xo
</p><p>
GOOSE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE COORDINATING THIS DOESNT MEAN YOU DONT GET SOME LOVE!! I appreciate everything you do, and all the time you put into this guild. Not everyone sees the processes you work through to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible, and I really want you to know that I LOVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO FOR US. You've been an amazingly supportive friend and I'm so glad our paths were able to stumble across eachother's. You're such a strong person, while also being able to be so kind and I think that's really inspirational.
</p><p>
jaaaaafaeriebubblesmieee: you are a great leader and I see our guild heading in such a strong direction much in part due to your leadership. you lead by example with your friendly attitude, and it carries throughout the entire guild's attitude towards one another. additionally, you are just an awesome person to be around! I hope yesterday your birthday with wonderful with your partner despite covid, you deserve all the special celebration in the world!
</p><p>
Jamie - You dedicate so much time to the guild and I admire you so much for that. In the few months I've known you, I've seen how the guild has grown, all because of your leadership and intiative and basically the way you treat everyone with love and kindness and how you see the guild as not something you own, but as a family. I'm thankful for you and all that you do for us everyday and every week and I just wanted you to know I appreciate you. You're the mother goose to us potato babies, we love you!!!!
</p><p>
Jamie – I don't really know where to start… I suppose to sum it up - you make Exodus feel like home. You made me feel so welcome since the day I met you and you have such amazing energy and humour. When I think back of all the funniest times I have had on Neo this year, you are always there - from funny pet names/customs, to elderly hasees, to everything in between. I am in AWE of how much you do for the guild… I really think you are superwoman. Thank you for everything.
</p><p>
Jamie, you're literally a breath of fresh air to the guild, and I have never met someone so determined to do the right thing. You're fiercely loyal, and I love seeing you take care of everyone in the guild. You're humble and never want to be in the spotlight, and I love your positivity!
</p><p>
Jamie…where do I even start! You are so cool and talented and dedicated and inspiring. Thank you for the amount of effort you put into making this guild such an awesome experience! I love and appreciate the amazing person you are inside and out!
</p><p>
Thanks you JAIME for always being so kind and compassionate, always friendly, and always kicking our tushes to get better at them flash games. I always look forward to chatting with you for all life's up and downs, and melted chocolate on IKEA comforters.
</p><p>
Jamie - I have so many words for you, but I'll try to be brief. I can't imagine the immense work that goes into running our little potato guild and I can't thank you enough for literally all of it. You've created a little tot family and I think I can speak for everyone when I say we absolutely adore you and all you've done! I absolutely adore getting to chat with you and I feel such a sense of accomplishment when I can tackle one of your crazy activities! I'm so glad we ran into each other in our previous guild because you are hands down one of my favorite people on this site!
</p><p>
Jamie (goosesticks): If someone looked up "friend" they would most certainly find Jamie's cutie face as the definition, because this is what she truly is. She's an outstanding person and I have no words to express how much your support, advices and conversations mean to me. I joined the guild while being in an odd, indecisive loop and you made me see that joining the guild was what I needed on this little virtual world. I'm beyond happy to be part of the guild and be able to see the wonderful people that run it, especially you. My eyes get delighted every single day by the dedication and enthusiasm you put into everything you for the guild and for us the members. Thank you so much for always being fully transparent, upfront and sincere with me. I hope we can keep on building a strong friendship together. Love you!
</p><p>
      Jamie - If you were a Powerpuff Girl, you'd be Blossom - Commander and the leader. Thank you for wrangling us in! I'm in constant awe of how you balance real life stuff and how you still make us all feel special and important.
</p><p>
        Jamie - You're honestly still one of the most dedicated people I've come to know. How you juggle everything you do is an inspiration to me!
</p><p>


</p><h3>JEN, ayumijen</h3><p>

Jen, you are a coding rockstar, but I love that that is not all that defines you. You are super supportive, and always ready to defend your friends and what you believe in, and I love that.
</p><p>
Jen: you are such a helpful person on the chat and I know I can always count on your food fight every friday to be the first in my inbox! you are truly a lovely person and I hope I get the chance to get to know you better in the guild~
</p><p>
Jen (ayumijen): We've known each other for ages and I had the pleasure to be in the same guildas in the past as well. Who would have thought we'd also find ourselves playing Overwach together (hating on the stupid lag that makes things even more complicated) Love to see you in the guild whenever you pop in and I always look forward to talking to you.
</p><p>

</p><p>



</p><h3>KAT, superkathiee</h3><p>

Kat – I think you are my soul mate and I think my partner [who I would name but I need to keep it anonymous] thinks I am leaving him for you. AND MAYBE HE IS RIGHT. You make me laugh so much and you are a fab friend. You are my sounding board and I am your muse. *insert pic of me as girl with the pearl earring here* You are the orange bob to my gingerbread woman. And as long as we stay friends, no one's neopoints need to be stolen ☺ ☺
</p><p>
Kat, you've already got a bunch about you, but just want to let you know how much I appreciate your sense of humour. It's next level, and you're able to let people shine with you. The guild is a much more fun place to be because of you!
</p><p>
Kat: you were one of the very first people I met in the guild and friended! In addition to always being so much help with avatars and general neo stuff, you are also just such a sweet and bright soul that lights up the guild chat regardless of the discussion!
</p><p>
Katdoatie- thanks for always making our daily faerie quests fun and guild night life exciting. There is no admin I'd rather stay up all night playing the longest game of av simon ever. And I love that you taunt our queen potato with your big brain av. I'm not really a shouty person, but it's cool that you are.
</p><p>
Katkatkat - what a bright light you are in everything you do. You bring so much joy and laughter to the guild and I appreciate how you are always positive. You are legit hilarious!! Just an all around cool person. This guild would not be the same without you!
</p><p>
Katkatkatkat - You're one of the funniest and funnest people I know on neo. You always take the time to help people out and give advice, and you always always spread positivity whenever you're on the boards. I often find myself getting excited when I see you online on my nf sidebar!
</p><p>
KATKATKATKAT should have her own TV show & I bet she is the life & soul in any room. Super bubbly, super funny, always the mood lifter!! c:
</p><p>
Katkatkatkat, a vibrant soul. She's always bringing some spice to the guild chat! Can always count on her humor or stories for a good laugh! ALL CAPS OR GO HOME!! But please, for the love of Christmas, keep your big toe to yourself!!!!
</p><p>Superkathiee: Kats fab, sometimes my phone autocorrect it to kad and it reminds me that I need to feed them dang pixels. She is an inspiration because she is LOUD, but in a way that lets you be loud too. Not the kind that speaks over you.<br>
Your presence is loud<br>
ALL CAPS HELP YOU THRIVE IN LIFE<br>
We should all be loud<br></p><p>
Katkatkat, thank you for always making me laugh and making me feel included.
</p><p>
Katkat- You are my guiding person in this guild when it comes to everything! You always have the best gaming tips, the best avvie tips, and are always the first to suggest a great font color or tip to create that perfect code. I love chatting with you and am always glad when I can be on at the same time!
</p><p>
Kat (superkathiee): Okay so can we all agree Kat is AWESOME? You make people laugh and that's something we all need in our lives. Someone as cheerful, witty and funny as you. Thank you for welcoming me with open arms as soon as I stepped inside the guild and for always show excitement whenever we start babbling on the guild boards. Please, don't stop typing in caps as it's what makes you UNIQUE ♥
</p><p>
      Katkatkat - Silly willy! I would love to spend a day in your brain sitting on a lawn chair, sippin a smoothie, sunglasses on seeing all the creativity that shines there.

</p><p>

</p><h3>KRYSTAL, mahnoosh</h3><p>

Krystal, even though we're star-crossed (cursed) now you've got your new job, I still want to say you're such a lovely person & thank you so much for all you've done for me in previous guilds! You might not even realise it but it felt like you completely took me under your wing, it was really nice to come to a new guild & always see you online_ where you never slept) & despite timezone you were constantly caring or interested. You're a huge reason I stayed in a guild & your friendliness/generosity/caring nature has always always stuck with me!
</p><p>
Krystal, your sense of humour gets me every time we're hanging out. The dry humour fits into any situation, and you always have something so witty to say!

      Krystal - You lil sweetie. You're always so helpful.
</p><p>

</p><h3>LAURA, insidiousruin</h3><p>

Laura, even though real life has made you frequent the guild less lately, I want to tell you how much you are loved! You're an awesome friend, and I know you will be great with animals (you already are) once you get out of schooling and can truly start working in a career you're already so passionate about. I can't wait to see your progress!
</p><p>
      Laura - You're busy being a boss irl. Your presence is missed but know you live rent free in my heart!
</p><p>

<p>
</p><h3>MAI, eleganza_lights</h3><p>

Mai - I appreciate how kind you are and your willingness to help even when it is not asked of you. I hope to catch you more on the boards and get to know you even better in the next months!
</p><p>
Mai, you're a bit mysterious to me, but I love how calm you are about everything, except when you get a bit mad. Then you're a spark and I love it!
</p><p>
Mai: I love when I see you on the boards, because I feel like we are becoming friends and pushing each other to elevate our gaming. You've rescued my fonts in the past and I'm so thankful for people that help the HTML illiterate.
</p><p>
Mai (eleganza_lights): For some reason whenever I talk to you I feel calm, it's like you have such a soft way to say things that really drag me in. I enjoy talking to you on the boards and I LOVE seeing you on the NCC quite frequently; all your pets always have the best customs!
</p><p>
      Mai - Font queen! You are so creative and talented.
</p><p>


</p><h3>MIKE, shatterell</h3><p>
Mike, you always have something interesting to say that either makes me laugh or think, and your coding work is also phenomenal. You have saved my neo-life with the neopets layout you created and I think you deserve more recognition for it.
</p><p>
        Mike - NEVER LEAVE EXODUS. Unless we all do for some weird reason, then jump ship with us. I don't often catch you on the boards but ~elsewhere~ you constantly have my laughing! I haven't actually used any of your work arounds that you've sent out either, but if they are as amazing as everyone says, clearly you have a great resume for a future job with TNT!
</p><p>


</p><h3>MIN, toastedmarshmallows</h3><p>
Min - you are just so funny! What a vibrant fun person. I love having you around!
</p><p>
Min, you're so sweet and loving to everyone here! I love your creativity, and ability to make me laugh (seriously, your ornament had me howling). I love how much you care for people, and so active and present to everyone!
</p><p>
Min: first of all, your username always makes me soooo hungry. But in a good way! You are also so sweet and a joy to interact with on the boards and I know I can always rely on you for a fun discussion about literally anything!
</p><p>
MINERVA, the beautifully toasted, the glorious MAARVELLOUSSS mad madam Min, (nobody has ever once called you this, I just remember that Disney's Sword in the Stone animation phrase just now HA) ~ you're such a sweetie & it makes me happy whenever I see you online_ Thank you for the chats & giggles you provide, I'm glad you found us & give us constant hoots like the orange wig fiasco... HAHAHHA!
</p><p>
Toastedmarshmallows (Min): I would've never thought that I'd have a chance to meet you knowing how different our timezones are, yet you quickly became one of my favorite British members. I wish I worked at the faerie fountain so I can dip in 10 marshmallow grundos a day so you can have the best and most tasty family ever. Thanks for the support, for the long and deep conversations held on the boards and for being an overall supportive person ♥ P.S: Your lookup is one of my favorites!!
</p><p>
      Min - I've been putting milk in my tea because of you and I LOVE IT.
</p><p>


</p><h3>MISA, d0odleb3rry</h3><p>
Misa - I love staying up late to get to talk to you! You are so bright, bubbly and fun! You are so creative. Your personality just draws people to you and you are always so supportive of everyone you know! It's a rare trait for someone to be that kind to everyone in your life. We are so lucky to have you here!
</p><p>
Misa is always there for Exodus when we need any help. She is supportive of everyone's Neo-goals and is willing to go above and beyond finding information to help people achieve them. She is always sharing her pound finds and is always there to help with a faerie quest. She is very patient and kind when it comes to questions. You can always count on Misa to have a good chat.
</p><p>
Misa, you're so supportive of people's passions, and so compassionate. I could tell by your support to your friend's comms for a cause campaign, and you got a bunch of us guildies supporting her cause too!
</p><p>
Misa: You literally can chat with ANYONE and find something in common. You have to be the kindest, sweetest people I've met on here. You are always encouraging and willing to lend an ear (and heart) and you have a lot going on at home, I'm thankful you put time into the guild.
</p><p>
      Misa - The first tater to tot! I still think it's hilarious that our first conversation was when you randomly asked to adopt one of my pets for her clothes. I love our bond over customizations, alien aishas, and baby pets!
</p><p>


</p><h3>MYSTIC, mysticferret15</h3><p>
Mystic - you're so sweet and kind, and I love how positive you always are!
</p><p>

</p><h3>ORI, taty_87</h3><p>
Ori - we don't know each other that well yet but I really like having you here! You are a fun person to chat with and so friendly. I'm really glad you joined us!!
</p><p>
Ori, we don't catch each other much due to time zones, but I love your passion for art, and your sense of humour! You are so nice to everyone in the guild!
</p><p>
      Ori - Sweet little mama! We are in different time zones but it's always such a treat to talk to you.

<p></p><h2>Q, R, & S</h2>


<p>

</p><h3>RAINE, x__pandora</h3><p>
Raine is actually the first person I met in the guild! I saw her on the PC when she was advertising for the CC the first time, and she had such a warm & inviting energy. I'd already seen ads for the previous guild but she was the first person I'd been comfortable approaching, it'd been 5 years since I was last on a guild after all. She was super helpful and welcoming, and kept me updated when we all moved over to Exodus. I'm eternally grateful for her enduring good natured self and can't thank her enough for being a part of why I came to Exodus in the first place.
</p><p>
Raine- tnt says you are the funniest person in our guild! You are witty and friendly and I love to see that you are on, because it's bound to be an encouraging and funny chat. I'll always vote for you in all your endeavors!
</p><p>
Raine, you are funny, and every time we talk, I laugh and have a good time. You're very caring, and always have good advice.
</p><p>
User pandora, you're one of my longest friends - all the way back from the guild I can't remember LOL. Oh, it was Azure! ANYWAY thanks for kadding with me. Secret confession, I made it a competition to beat you to 75 but I never told you because if I lost I didn't want to admit defeat . You're literally so lovely and I appreciate your presence, you're someone I would definitely try and have an awkward irl neopets meet up with if I ever happen to be on that side of the world.
</p><p>
Raine, thank you for sharing the story about your parents, it really helped me alot.
</p><p>
      Raine - I love hearing your travel stories, voting for you hilarious captions, you bring such a great presence to the guild!
</p><p>

</p><h3>ROXI, roxi2rox</h3><p>
I honestly believe that if Roxi and I had met in person in our younger years we might have toppled at least 1 oppressive establishment by now, the chaotic energy is strong here. I adore her though. She's been a constant companion on my boards the past long while and is always online_ I don't know how she does it, but she always finds me and it's nice to have the company, especially on places like the PC. She's also always around for a laugh and to chat back & forth about just about anything, which has been an immeasurably valuable thing to me as I go through the next huge phase of my life outside of neo. I'm super grateful to have her around and hope she doesn't tire of me anytime soon.
</p><p>
Rox is one of the nicest guildies, & has been from the get go c: We always used to chat together & work for avs together, I was always so appreciative to log online_ amp; see her or have her around to chat to! I wanna say thank you for being sooo lovely to me, you're one of my faves & I'm so glad we've stayed in the same guilds all this time!
</p><p>
Roxi - Our very own guild bot. Always online_ Generous and helpful. Willing to help in any way and all ways. Chatting with you is always fun, you never seem to run out of knowledge to impart, whether it be neo-related or not.
</p><p>
Roxi- I sincerely enjoy your random spaztastic emails, they make me light up and encourage me that I always have a friend thinking about me, even when I'm avoiding human contact.
</p><p>
Roxi, I believe you are an AI techo that never sleeps. That is the only way to explain your constant presence but also your suspiciously great sense of humour and ability to talk to every single person in the guild in a way that makes them feel so at home. You just really make me laugh and whenever I lurk and see you I'm like YES THIS IS MY TIME TO GET MY DAILY LAUGH QUOTA IN ONE SWOOP. Also I dunno but your so cute I could just PINCH YOUR CHEEKS... but I won't. Also thanks for Slorgbride (wait does this ruin the game? If yes, Jamie you can replace the word with asterisks for a fun guessing game - what am I thankful for?!)
</p><p>
Roxi, you are one of the first people I've met when I joined, only knowing one other person at the time. You are beautiful inside and out. You bring humor and good conversation to the guild. Your crazy techno avatar brings the guild LIFE. You are generous and helpful always and you are v appreciated by me!!!
</p><p>
Roxi, you're a fire like I've never seen before and I love it! You are outspoken, and stand your ground on what you believe in, and I love that you speak up when you don't want to do something. You're ok with telling people no, and I admire that about you so much!
</p><p>
Rox (roxi2rox): I'll defend you no matter what, even if Jamie feels like charging you rent twice in a month. You should live in Exodus rent-free for being the wonderful person you are. I love your sense of humor and I feel like whenever we get to talk to each other we ALWAYS agree on everything, and I like that. I like you lots!
</p><p>
      Roxi - I love our late night party chats and schemes to find Neo sugar daddies! You make me laugh so much and I'm so glad that we've gotten closer.
</p><p>

</p><h3>SAMARA, hunni_bun_137</h3><p>

Samara - you are such a super mom! I have no idea how you can raise an entire family and still be super active and involved in running this guild! (But I am so glad you do!!) I always look forward to seeing you in the guild chat when I stay up too late. You give off warm mom vibes in the best way. Your kids are lucky to have a mom who is generous and loving and forgiving, and we are lucky to have a friend like that!
</p><p>
Samara, you are such a gentle and sweet soul. You are so amazing with your boys and your motherly nature shines in the way you care about the members of Exodus. I always get excited when you're on the boards, I love having conversations with you! You're one of the first people I met and I really cherish our friendship.
</p><p>
Samara, you're a super mom! I love your love for your boys! You're always so level headed, and I admire that about you! You're definitely a good balance to have in the council + the guild!
</p><p>
      Samara - You make raising 3 boys look so easy! You're such a sweetheart, I enjoy talking to you and hearing to your stories!
</p><p>
    Samara, thank you so much for reaching out to me in regards to my personal situation. It meant a lot to me and it's so nice to be able to talk to someone about it, especially someone that can relate. I appreciated it so much! Thank you for being there for me.
</p><p>


</p><h3>SOSU, sosunub</h3><p>

Sosu - I admire your talent and creativity in making lookups and graphics and collecting avatars and customizing pets. You motivate me to become better and to do better and you're one of the reasons why I've decided to create gallery layouts! Thank you so much :)
</p><p>
Sosu – you an angel amongst people. You have the most humble, kind, wonderful energy you have brought to the guild. Always willing to speak to everyone and empathise/listen to them. Even though you are busy being a BIG NAME on neo, you still have the time and generosity to create lookups for people, graphics for the guild, and to be a great friend. Thank you for everything!
</p><p>
Sosu, sosu, sosu... can I just be you please.??? Avatar count, coding, pets, customs, NC, NB PENS, gallery, shop.... the list is endless. HOW DOES ONE PERSON HAVE IT ALL YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE INCREDIBLE. You put us all to shame. Also did I mention avatar count. Or pets.... *trails off into endless list again*
</p><p>
Sosu, you're wildly talented, and I'm so glad I met you. Beyond the art world, you've been super giving, and willing to help. I love how loyal you are and you've only joined us a short time ago. I love that you always want to help, and you are so supportive of my passions. Even though we've only known each other for a little while, it makes me so happy that you're a part of Exodus. You are truly one of the nicest people I've had the pleasure of meeting.
</p><p>
        <img src="http://images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/yellowleaf.gif">
    </p><p>
      Sosu - My dear, your coding knows no bounds! I mean, I wish I had half the talent you had. Just absolutely in awe every time you create something new
</p><p>
      Sosu - Mr. Graphics master! Here's hoping we can ride bikes in Argentina
</p><p>
        Sosu, master at graphics and coding, I am seriously in awe at your work and I hope one day I can be as talented as you!
</p><p>
        Sosu - You are incredibly TALENTED! Like my goodness, can you teach me your ways? Everything you do is so beautiful and to make you an even more amazing human being, you're kind and wonderful as well. Thank you for always being wonderful  I'm glad to have met you!
</p><p>
        Sosu, you are so incredibly talented and you deserve all of the recognition!!!
